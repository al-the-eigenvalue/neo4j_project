0,Albedo,Barbara,"Barbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort."
1,Albedo,Jean,"Jean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master, one can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself."
2,Albedo,Klee,"Indeed, I view Klee as my younger sister. Whenever she gets herself into some explosive sort of trouble, I can only console myself with the fact that her current destructiveness is nothing compared to that of Miss Alice."
3,Albedo,Lisa,Lisa? I always am impressed by the valuable perspectives she brings to discussions. But is a person with her talents satisfied with such a basic occupation as librarian? There must be some hidden reason for this.
4,Albedo,Sucrose,"Sucrose? I think I more or less understand why she is so dedicated to her research in bio-alchemy... Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors.
Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me ""Albedo"" since we are hardly generations apart, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. *sigh* ...Whatever she prefers, I guess."
5,Albedo,Xingqiu,"Oh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?"
6,Alhaitham,Cyno,"The hivemind case certainly added to the matra's workload, but my conscience is clear. The root cause of what ultimately transpired actually has nothing to do with me at all. I'm sure Cyno appreciates that, as he hasn't once approached me about the incident."
7,Alhaitham,Dehya,"It's a waste for such a capable person to remain among the Eremites. If only she'd consider my suggestion to join the Akademiya... Our work would become a lot easier with someone like her around, but a predictable life isn't exactly her cup of tea — I can understand that. *sigh* What a pity."
8,Alhaitham,Dori,"She's sharp and always keeps an eye out for herself. She knows how to take life by the reins and make her dreams a reality. I'm not condoning her actions, but just because we stand on different sides doesn't mean that I can't appreciate her attitude towards life."
9,Alhaitham,Kaveh,"Kaveh tends to be overly sensitive about everyone and everything he crosses paths with, and he's constantly making a fuss about nothing. Maybe it's because he's too emotionally fragile...
Someone set up a stand on the street saying that for each handmade keychain they sold, a child in poverty would be given a meal. Kaveh bought at least a dozen....This is Sumeru, where even healthcare is free. I needn't say more."
10,Alhaitham,Nahida,"One should neither dismiss nor overly revere the divine. Gods require followers, and they are also part of a biological hierarchy. That's why I don't take any pride in the fact that I helped rescue a god. I hope Lesser Lord Kusanali doesn't take offense."
11,Alhaitham,Nilou,"The strengths and weaknesses of a performing artist are quite clear. Nilou knows how to play to her strengths, which enables her to live a happy and simple life."
12,Alhaitham,Tighnari,"Apparently, a lot of people think he has a bad temperament, but I don't think they're giving him a fair chance. When Kaveh built a house right over a Withering Zone and created a huge mess, it ended up being a real headache for the Forest Rangers. Even so, this Forest Ranger didn't hold it against Kaveh. He even invited Kaveh to his house for a meal. Hmm, maybe it's good people like him who allow people like Kaveh to survive."
13,Amber,Albedo,"Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you can never quite tell what he is thinking, not a clue at all."
14,Amber,Bennett,"Hmm? Bennett... I feel like I've heard that name before... Oh! Yes, he's that hot-blooded guy from the Adventurers' Guild, right! I tend to come across him way out in the wild from time to time, he seems to really love treasure hunting."
15,Amber,Collei,"Collei wrote to me saying that her Eleazar has been completely cured... I'm so happy for her! I wish I could fly to her side right now and give her the biggest hug! She also said she misses everyone in Mondstadt, and that once she's ready, she'll come visit us in person and tell us all about her progress... Oh, it would be great if she could make it in time for the next Ludi Harpastum. Aaah I can't wait to see her again!"
16,Amber,Eula,Eula is a great friend of mine! You just need to get used to her sense of humor and you'll get along fine! The only reason she's misunderstood by so many people is her family name. How can I get them to see her for who she really is?
17,Amber,Jean,"After the Grand Master left on his expedition, all the affairs of the Knights of Favonius, both big and small, have been left up to Jean. If only there was more I could do to help her...
Jean might still be working? We should invite her for coffee... Let's go."
18,Amber,Kaeya,"...I'm feeling uneasy all of a sudden! Was that Kaeya with you earlier? Did he give you any trouble?
There's something weird-looking about the dandelions in the garden... Hmm, I bet Kaeya had something to do with this!"
19,Amber,Klee,"Klee? She can be a bit cheeky sometimes, but everyone in the Knights of Favonius likes her. Although... I really ought to keep a closer eye on her if I wanna keep her from getting put in confinement by Jean again."
20,Amber,Lisa,"When you have time, we should go see Lisa! Last time I saw her, she was telling me about a story involving a treasure in the Dragonspine area. But, we got cut off before she could finish. I can't wait to hear the rest of her story!
If Lisa's not sleeping, she'll be reading! I don't know how she does it, I wouldn't be able to sit still for that long."
21,Amber,Mika,"Oh! Mika's a veteran of Eula's team. When he first arrived, it was always ""Yes, Commander!"" every time he spoke to me — I guess it must have been because he saw how close I was with Eula. But then, even after I told him I was actually an Outrider, he still called me ""Ma'am""... It was so embarrassing. We have completely different responsibilities, after all. I definitely could never match his expertise in cartography."
22,Amber,Noelle,"You wanna know about Noelle? She's super resilient. Still, since she's younger than us, we should look out for her."
23,Arataki Itto,Gorou,"Oh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit. Also, he gives off this vibe that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, almost as if he understands my innermost feelings... I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird."
24,Arataki Itto,Kaedehara Kazuha,"Word on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome! Who knows how he pulled it off. Hey, now that I think about it, he's from a fallen clan, and I'm from a fallen clan... That kinda makes us equals, haha! Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!"
25,Arataki Itto,Kamisato Ayato,"Haha, I only wish I could have met Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. ""You can kindle the warrior spirit even in the weakest of bugs""... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time... Yeah, I guess sometimes it takes a warrior to understand a warrior. When we're playing trading card games or battling beetles, we're always totally on the same wavelength."
26,Arataki Itto,Kujou Sara,"You know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that."
27,Arataki Itto,Kuki Shinobu,"Nobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes — except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare."
28,Arataki Itto,Raiden Shogun,"During the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance."
29,Arataki Itto,Sayu,"All I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing..."
30,Arataki Itto,Thoma,"Some of the boys have been telling me that he was the star of the show at the Vision Hunt Ceremony. I'm like — are you kidding me??? How come he gets his own special ceremony!? Was the hundredth Vision supposed to be, like, stronger than the other ninety-nine, or something? Pff, nah, it can't have been that, 'cause, uh, hello! They would've chosen me if that's what they were going for."
31,Arataki Itto,Yae Miko,"I crushed that Kitsune Ramen eating contest we had. Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way — she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!"
32,Arataki Itto,Yoimiya,"Hmph, she's always showing off her fancy fireworks and toys to the kids. Well, I'm sick of it! Nobody steals my thunder! I'm the one that's supposed to be adored by the kids! Me! That goes for you too, you're siding with me on this, okay... Huh? Whaddya mean, you're not a kid? Eh, details. If you're shorter than me, you're a kid as far as I'm concerned."
33,Arlecchino,Columbina,"She is a very special Harbinger. Pose her a question, and the answer you receive will be entirely unpredictable, if she sees fit to give a proper answer at all. Regardless, any answer you do receive is sure to be an interesting one."
34,Arlecchino,Freminet,"Freminet has a complex mind and often hides his emotions. He blames himself for things that aren't his doing and allows them to eat away at his conscience. I would imagine the other children might find it difficult to understand his manner of thinking, but you seem to share a similar delicate sensibility — perhaps you two would make good friends."
35,Arlecchino,Furina,"I asked Lyney to deliver an assortment of cakes for her theater troupe to enjoy during teatime. The children made the cakes themselves as a gesture to express the support and enthusiasm of her ""audience."" I do hope she enjoys them."
36,Arlecchino,Il Capitano,"He is very powerful, and that power comes with a high level of responsibility. However, I believe him to be someone worthy of respect independent of the power he holds."
37,Arlecchino,Il Dottore,"When I first took over the House of the Hearth, he proposed a number of plans for us to work together. He wanted me to send any ""rejects"" to him. He planned to experiment on them and then share the results with me. I heard that he and the previous Knave had quite the professional rapport in that regard. All I can say is that, if he weren't one of my fellow Harbingers, I would have expedited their happy, little reunion long ago."
38,Arlecchino,Lynette,"Lynette's uniquely calm personality is also her strength, and I believe she is more than clever enough to recognize that. She is an irreplaceable part of that little team of three, and I would imagine that role brings her much joy. As her ""Father,"" my duty is merely to give her the space to put those talents to good use."
39,Arlecchino,Lyney,"Clervie once asked me what a ""real home"" looks like, but I had no answer for her. How could any of us know the answer when the House of the Hearth is made up entirely of people who never had a place to call home.By killing Crucabena, I was able to assume the identity of ""Father"" and rebuild the House under a new set of rules. Still, I'm well aware that, even with these efforts, the House is far from that ideal. As for what a real home truly looks like, I suppose that question is best put to the side for now... Perhaps one day, Lyney will be able to give me a new answer."
40,Arlecchino,Neuvillette,"Monsieur Neuvillette intentionally maintains a certain ""distance"" in professional and private settings. Many say this makes him cold and unfeeling, but I believe the truth is just the opposite. In order for all beings to be treated equally under the law, a certain level of emotional distance is expected. Maintaining that kind of indifference is, in itself, a demonstration of kindness."
41,Arlecchino,Pantalone,"I won't deny that he is a capable and imaginative individual, but he lacks ""clarity."" He can formulate grand plans and manipulate the economy with ease, yet at the same time, he allows his actions to be governed by the vengeance and hatred locked in the depths of his heart. Rational people often believe themselves capable of controlling their emotions, but I believe that confidence is their greatest weakness."
42,Arlecchino,Pierro,"As the original Harbinger, much about him remains a mystery. Upon our first meeting, he recognized my background with ease, yet to this day, I know little about him."
43,Arlecchino,Pulcinella,"The Rooster holds little love for me, and the feeling is mutual. He is an acceptable mayor, I suppose... perhaps even an exceptional one. He has an uncanny ability to make great gains at a small price, which has earned him substantial acclaim throughout his political circles. However ""small"" the price may be, if it continues to come at the expense of my organization, sooner or later... Hmph."
44,Arlecchino,Sandrone,"I have little interest in her. She is extremely... passionate about her research and does not appear in public often. In fact, many of our officers have yet to see her at all. Compared to, let's say, someone who would go so far as to create segments of themselves to better wander across the land, I suppose you could say she is at the other end of the extreme."
45,Arlecchino,Tartaglia,"Objectively speaking, his personality is ill-suited to that of a Harbinger. He often tries to think the best of others... and finds himself used by them as a result. Of course, he is very talented. With time, I'm sure he'll come into his own. I see no need to judge him too early."
46,Arlecchino,Tsaritsa,"When I was imprisoned, it was the Tsaritsa who pardoned me and gave me the title of Harbinger. I could sense she was a person of true sincerity and compassion, unlike all those pompous hypocrites with their posturing and rhetoric. Yet... It's difficult to say whether her compassion alone is enough to melt the ice and snow that permeates her land. All I can say is this... If we are forced to be at odds one day, I will raise my weapon against her without hesitation, because that is the greatest level of respect I am able to bestow."
47,Baizhu,Gaming,"Gaming has quite a lot of scars and old injuries compared to other people his age. And every time he comes to see me, he always seems to have a new bruise here, and a new sprain there... *sigh* No matter how many times I insist that he needs to be more careful, it always goes in one ear and out the other. All I can do is teach him some useful techniques for dressing and treating his wounds. I hope he finds them useful."
48,Baizhu,Ganyu,"Those with the blood of the adepti have strong constitutions. Even when she is ill or injured, she does not require any medicine to recover. She isn't like your average mortal, who would be left with long-term residual issues if they did not receive medical treatment after a serious injury."
49,Baizhu,Hu Tao,"We have some differences in ideology, that's all. I don't harbor any ill-will toward Director Hu. If anything, I think she's more wary of me.
Baizhu: If possible, I sincerely wish that Director Hu would be more sensible about her business practices.Changsheng: Oh, so you haven't forgotten about the time when she was disseminating flyers right outside of Bubu Pharmacy.Baizhu: *sigh* I just wish that she wouldn't be so concerned about Qiqi whenever she has nothing better to do.Changsheng: Sounds like you have something against her...Baizhu: It's not that I take issue with Director Hu... It's just that every time she kidnaps Qiqi, I have to go all the way to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to get someone to sort it all out. It's... quite exhausting."
50,Baizhu,Keqing,"If I were to hazard a guess about her health from a face reading, I would presume the Yuheng's frequent looks of exhaustion are due to her long-time habits of burning the midnight oil and never giving her mind a rest. If she wishes to maintain her health, she should stop working and relax from time to time. Unfortunately, she is overly ambitious, and seems to be completely willing to trade her health for her career. Even if I were to tell her this myself, I'm afraid she would not listen to me."
51,Baizhu,Qiqi,"Yes, you've guessed correctly. The preservation of a thread of Qiqi's consciousness was in fact the work of the adepti. It's also thanks to Qiqi that I managed to come up with a way to save someone on the brink of death. Since the adepti took pity on this child and even used their arts to keep her on this side of existence, I thought I'd take the opportunity to keep her around the pharmacy. There's no harm in that, is there?"
52,Baizhu,Tighnari,"Ah, so you have an acquaintance from the Sumeru Akademiya? In that case, could I trouble you to introduce me to this Tighnari? I have many questions about herbal medicine that I would like to ask him."
53,Baizhu,Xiao,"Baizhu: Only the most magnanimous soul could labor to preserve life by slaying evil spirits. I was once fortunate enough to see the Conqueror of Demons with my own eyes. We even brought him back to the pharmacy to take care of him for a day. Unfortunately, I did not know his true identity at the time, and didn't even have a chance to speak with him before he left on his own.Changsheng: But you've seen him since then, haven't you? There's no reason to be upset.Baizhu: Yes, you're right."
54,Baizhu,Yaoyao,"Every time she comes to play with Qiqi, she complains about the taste of medicine and asks me if I have anything that isn't bitter. If the medicine will save someone's life, who cares how bitter it tastes, hmm?"
55,Baizhu,Zhongli,"Ah, Zhongli... Yes, I can tell he is very knowledgeable. He can carry a conversation even when discussing niche topics like ancient medicine. He must also have some habits and practices for himself when it comes to healthy living. The common headache or fever should pose no problem for him, so he doesn't need a prescription from me."
56,Barbara,Amber,I've seen Amber rushing out of Mondstadt on a mission countless times. Being an Outrider doesn't look easy.
57,Barbara,Bennett,"Bennett always comes to the Cathedral covered in scrapes and bruises... Though it clearly never bothers him a bit, given the big grin he always has on his face. He really should take better care of himself."
58,Barbara,Diluc,"Oh, Master Diluc? Last time, when I was performing at Angel's Share, he kept frowning... Maybe he doesn't like my singing?"
59,Barbara,Jean,Acting Grand Master... Leader of the Knights of Favonius... Everyone seems to like her a lot. Oh? Me? I... Of course I have nothing but admiration for her!
60,Barbara,Lisa,"I always take good care of Lisa. If she ever wants to become a star, she'll have my unconditional support, I'll cheer at the top of my lungs until my voice goes hoarse... Hmm, that might scare off her other fans though..."
61,Barbara,Noelle,"Noelle is just the cutest! She's so kind and patient, you just feel totally relaxed when you're around her. ...Oh yeah, and she makes the tastiest snacks! Best part is, they're also healthy. Hehehe!"
62,Barbara,Rosaria,"Sister Rosaria is hard to get to know, especially given she never joins in on prayers, but... Oh, I'm sure she believes in the Anemo Archon! Although, I still don't really have the courage to try to talk to her..."
63,Barbara,Varka,"My father left on the expedition with Grand Master Varka... I hope they are okay. Oh, what am I worried about? The Grand Master is none other than the Knight of Boreas, of course they will be fine! Still, I will be sure to pray for their safe return."
64,Barbara,Venti,Venti's voice is amazing! But all the songs he sings and the ones I'm good at are very different. I tried to learn them but... the melodies are just so complicated.
65,Beidou,Ganyu,"Privately, Ganyu and I get on like a house on fire! But as you know, she's the secretary to the Liyue Qixing... and I'm not exactly in their good books right now! Doesn't bother me, but I wouldn't want to put Ganyu in a difficult position. So just keep what I said between us, yeah?"
66,Beidou,Kaedehara Kazuha,"Kazuha? That scallywag actually blocked a strike from the Raiden Shogun outside Tenshukaku! Easier said than done... After the battle he came to the Crux Fleet — said he'd voyage with us a while longer. I was more than happy to oblige. If the day comes when he decides to set off again by himself on the next stage of his journey, I'll send him off with a drink, haha..."
67,Beidou,Ningguang,"Ningguang, eh? As far as Liyue Qixing is concerned, she seems to be doing a good job. But for me, my responsibility lies with my ship and my men, and not with Liyue Qixing.
Ningguang is never really one to speak frankly, but she has been very direct with her criticism of me in the past. Haha... But hey, whether she likes me or hates me is her choice, nothing I can do to sway her."
68,Beidou,Xiangling,"When we're out on the open ocean, the one thing we do all miss is Xiangling's cooking. When spirits are low, just thinking of her fried jueyun chili, bursting with flavor... It gives everyone just that little extra kick.
Xiangling huh? She sometimes uses some... interesting ingredients in her dishes to bring about some, ah... intriguing flavors. Though... there's no way she can improve without having someone to taste-test — a role that I am more than happy to fill."
69,Beidou,Xiao,"One year on the eve of the Lantern Rite, we ran into a storm as we were returning to port. Try as we did, we only made it back to Liyue Harbor in the dead of night, long after the lanterns had all been released. As I looked towards Guyun Stone Forest, I saw an adeptus, floating in the air, in the form of what appeared to be a young boy. I guess it is like the legends say — there really must be those that watch over Liyue, even if they cannot be seen."
70,Beidou,Xinyan,"She's got a great personality, that one! The guys in the crew love that rock and roll of hers. Me? We have common ground, just... not when it comes to taste in music."
71,Beidou,Yaoyao,"Yaoyao always comes on board to play when we're in the harbor. Trouble is, when it's time for her to go she gives you the puppy eyes, and no one has the heart to send her away... Means we're always cutting it quite close by the time we manage to set sail."
72,Beidou,Zhongli,"You mean the gentleman from Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? My men sometimes speak of the rumors surrounding him — he sounds interesting. Yes, if I get the chance I'd like to meet him someday."
73,Bennett,Amber,"Oh, I know who you mean. The girl who's always charging around all over the place. She's always off adventuring in the wild, just like me... But if you ever see her near a cooking pot, you'll soon find a cloud of thick black smoke blowing in your direction, followed by the smell of burnt steak... Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?"
74,Bennett,Barbara,"She's the best singer and dancer out there! I always go to watch her in concert after an adventure goes south — it really lifts my mood, chanting along with all the other fans, cheering her on. It's really kinda magical! It's no wonder she's so popular... Boy, if I had even half her popularity as leader of my adventure team..."
75,Bennett,Fischl,"Oh yeah, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung from the world beyond! She's amazing. I keep asking her if we can go adventuring in her home world together, but each time I bring it up she sort of avoids the topic... She's probably just worried about my safety. Her home world sounds like a dangerous place, for sure."
76,Bennett,Jean,"I keep meaning to ask Master Jean for some help with the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild, but I don't know how to go about it. The Guild doesn't have as many rules and regulations as the Knights of Favonius, the dads and I are pretty laid back about everything. Pretty sure that attitude wouldn't fly with Jean though... I guess I should read up on the Knights' etiquette or something?"
77,Bennett,Klee,"She's a cute kid... but I have to keep my distance. Whenever she plays with me, her bombs always end up going off... It's not so much me I'm worried about, it would just be awful if something happened to Klee. The Knights of Favonius would never forgive me, that's for sure."
78,Bennett,Noelle,"Noelle's someone I've been watching for a while. She's really talented, and extremely hardworking. But somehow she's still a maid — the Knights of Favonius still haven't made her a knight. It's a shame, don't you think? Boy, if she switched to the Adventurers' Guild, she'd easily be one of the best there is."
79,Bennett,Razor,"Wolvendom guy! Looks a little on the feral side... doesn't talk much... but he's alright! We both love eating meat, so we got that in common. I sometimes cook some meat for him, and he teaches me how wolves communicate in return. Haha! You should join us next time!"
80,Bennett,Varka,"He's my role model! Talk about team leaders — he's the Grand Master! Leads the whole darn Knights of Favonius! How incredible do you have to be to do that!? Recently, though, I've been thinking that having a smaller Adventure Team isn't such a bad thing after all. I mean, if things got too busy in the team, I'd have no time to look after all my dads in the guild, would I? Yeah... Yeah, things are fine the way they are."
81,Candace,Alhaitham,"A truly unusual scholar, unlike any other I've ever met. He sees and thinks about things in his own unique way... I only hope he never wields his sharp mind against the peace of Aaru Village."
82,Candace,Cyno,"In the past, it was rare to see the Akademiya's General Mahamatra on this side of the Wall of Samiel, but recently he has been showing up here all the time. I believe that the Eremites have some truly terrifying stories to tell about him..."
83,Candace,Dehya,"Whenever Dehya brings any of her Eremites to stay at Aaru Village, she always keeps them on their very best behavior. I have to say, it makes my life a lot easier. Ah, Dehya... She might look like trouble at first, but the truth is that she's really quite adorable."
84,Candace,Layla,"An eccentric girl who always seems to be in a trance...? Yes, I believe I've seen her before — near the Wall of Samiel. I couldn't make sense of what she was saying, nor the calculations she wrote down, but she seemed to be in a much better mood after she'd finished. Perhaps this is her way of relieving stress."
85,Candace,Nahida,"Perhaps it is a testament to the Dendro Archon's benevolence that I, a descendant of the Al-Ahmar bloodline, am able to live peacefully on this land. If so, I suppose I am grateful for this much, but... I am first and foremost a child of the desert."
86,Candace,Sethos,"The sons and daughters of King Deshret are a proud people, and he is no exception. I have heard his tale, of Hermanubis's glory dwelling within a worthy vessel. I also understand he has been active in Sumeru City recently? Apparently, he has spoken to Cyno and other friends of his plans to visit Aaru Village. I look forward to hosting him."
87,Charlotte,Chiori,"I did a little snooping around at Chioriya Boutique once. Aside from the wealthy housewives of Fontaine and the box-ticking tourists from overseas, some of the regular customers there look like really rough characters! Big muscly types with scars on their face, guys in masks and hats with their swords drawn... But they always come bearing gifts and acting like humble servants. Uh... Well, mostly. Anyone with a bad attitude is literally sent flying back out the door. Seriously! I snapped a photo of a guy being thrown out once, he was like four feet in the air!"
88,Charlotte,Clorinde,"Clorinde is the most well-known Champion Duelist in Fontaine, but she's also the most mysterious. I have a source who tells me that she uses some sort of mystical ritual to keep her weapon as good as new... Could this be the secret behind her famously undefeated track record in the Duelists' Ring? Ah, I'd love to spring that question on her one day... but I don't think I'll get the chance. She's publicly stated that she doesn't accept interviews."
89,Charlotte,Emilie,"Emilie makes the best perfume in the whole Court of Fontaine. She introduced me to this amazing one the other day that works as an insect repellent, anti-perspirant, and deodorant all in one! It's a total life-saver for someone like me who spends so much time zooming around all over the place. I actually sprayed some on my wrist today... Go on, take a whiff, it's heavenly!"
90,Charlotte,Freminet,"I've met Freminet a few times since being introduced. He quickly took an interest in Monsieur Verite — that's my Kamera-slash-assistant — and even made a few improvements to my lenses. I gotta say, though, my heart was in my mouth watching him completely dismantle Monsieur Verite in a matter of seconds... Amazing he managed to reassemble it just as swiftly. He seems very experienced — I was convinced he must have graduated from the Fontaine Research Institute, but he denied it."
91,Charlotte,Furina,"Lady Furina has a very captivating presence. She was born to be a star. Euphrasie once assigned a journalist to shadow her, but he quit not long into the assignment... From what I've heard, the reason he left was that Furina insisted on seeing every photo he took of her right away, and she'd make him redo it if she wasn't happy with how it turned out. Apparently, she was so picky that the poor guy once had to take 127 shots of her in the same pose before she was content..."
92,Charlotte,Lynette,"No matter what question you pose to her, Lynette just calmly lowers her eyes with an expressionless look on her face. It's like she's some sort of... clockwork doll. I'm really tempted to write an article titled something like: ""The Genius Magician's Puppet Assistant: Magic's Best-Kept Secret""... but I have a sneaking suspicion that even that wouldn't get a reaction out of her."
93,Charlotte,Lyney,"Surprise, surprise — Lyney refused an interview with me once again. Do you know how many times that is now? ...Uh, actually, I've lost count. But never mind! Evading me only further confirms my suspicion that he's hiding the news story of a lifetime! As long as I keep digging, I'll find it — and when I do, it will shake the world like no other news report in history!"
94,Charlotte,Navia,"Now that her father's name's been cleared, and the case of the serial disappearances of young women is resolved, I guess Navia must be able to finally breathe a little easier. I don't know why, but somehow, she's found herself at the epicenter of all sorts of bad news lately... Luckily for her, I've been snatching up all the articles that mention her and doing whatever damage control I can before they get published. Heh, and uh... then getting told off constantly by Euphrasie for interfering... But y'know, I think Navia deserves a break, so I'm happy to take one for the team. Also, she agreed to do an in-depth exclusive interview, which definitely sweetens the deal!"
95,Charlotte,Neuvillette,"If you want to interview the Iudex, you have to provide all the interview questions in advance and get them reviewed by the relevant department at the Palais Mermonia, who decide which questions to approve and which ones you're not allowed to ask... It's their way of making sure the interview goes off without a hitch. It's such a rigmarole. I'm losing the will to live just talking about it."
96,Charlotte,Wriothesley,"So... Did you get to meet the Duke in person? Yeah? Any nuggets of information that I should know about? Never mind the Credit Coupons, the Coupon Cafeteria, ""If a man will not work, he shall not eat""... That's all just generic filler. I'm talking about personal anecdotes about the man of Meropide himself... What do you mean, ""confidentiality""? Aw, not you, too! We had a deal! That does it — remember that gigantic feast I treated you to? I want my money back! Get your butts back to prison and do your time, you swindlers, you!"
97,Chevreuse,Charlotte,"Charlotte is the type of reporter that really gives you a headache. Whenever there's a major case, she's always one of the first people in the vicinity no matter how hard we try to secure the scene. One time, she was even detained as a suspect for half a month, but she was still able to finish her article while in custody... I really do need to find the time to have a formal conversation with her editor about her behavior."
98,Chevreuse,Chiori,"Chiori's method of resolving disputes is bit radical. But, she has quite the network at her disposal and has provided the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with intelligence on more than one occasion. In return, I turn a blind eye whenever she throws someone out the door or runs a malignant competitor out of business. If you look into it, you'll find that Chiori is always in the right. She's just not the type to waste her breath on explanations."
99,Chevreuse,Clorinde,"Clorinde has built quite the reputation for herself in Fontaine as a Champion Duelist. Our positions are different, so I'm not at liberty to make any comments about her work. But I trust that she takes on those duels out of her own sense of justice."
100,Chevreuse,Emilie,"Emilie is a good friend. Her expert knowledge of chemistry has been a great help to me many times when analyzing evidence or tracking down a killer. She helps us discover information that no one else can see, like what type of perfume a suspect wore or what type of flowers they sent as a gift. She can even determine the places they've been right down to the very dirt they've stepped in... Plus, she's never been wrong."
101,Chevreuse,Freminet,"I once saw Freminet in a shop when we both reached for the same gadget. It was the last one available, but just as I was about to tell him he could have it, he withdrew his hand and ran out of the store. It might sound odd, but he fled like the Gardes were after him."
102,Chevreuse,Furina,"Lady Furina once ordered us to carry out some sort of... ceremonial musketeer performance. She not only wanted each of us outfitted with special ""ceremonial muskets,"" but she wanted us to practice all sorts of specialized drill formations as well. Luckily, in the end, she couldn't find the right song to pair with the performance and the matter was dropped entirely."
103,Chevreuse,Lyney,"Lyney is quite the famous magician. We once had a case where we arrested a magician suspected of deliberate harm, fraudulent behavior, and murder, but we could never figure out his methods. In the end, we brought on Lyney as a consultant. He helped us find a crucial piece of evidence that led to the successful conviction of the suspect. I heard that an author actually used that case as the basis for their mystery novel about a magician who used their craft to commit crimes.Unfortunately... the author ended up going a little overboard on the graphic detail, and since the crime is still fresh in everyone's minds, it'll be a while before they're able to get it published."
104,Chevreuse,Navia,"I've heard about the murder case involving Navia's father. It caused quite the stir in the Maison Gardiennage at the time. It was the source of many disagreements, I believe.Fortunately, the truth has come to light and the true culprit has been held accountable... Justice may not always be swift, but it always prevails in the end."
105,Chevreuse,Neuvillette,"Everyone knows that the Iudex abstains himself of all personal emotion when presiding over a trial. Some even say he lacks the warmth of human emotion. But the way I see it, justice should remain uncorrupted by personal feelings. Those who break the law bear guilt. It's as simple as that."
106,Chevreuse,Sigewinne,"The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol has a long-lasting friendship with the Melusines. We often collaborate with the Melusines who work in the Marechaussee Phantom. They're kind, honest, and reliable. When it comes to handling major cases, the role they play is irreplaceable. I, myself, am quite close to several Melusines, Sigewinne included.Melusines have long been one of our most indispensable partners. If there continue to be those who dare to slander and belittle their name, then they'll find themselves looking down the barrels of our muskets."
107,Chevreuse,Wriothesley,The work Wriothesley does is highly effective. As least all criminals know that the Fortress of Meropide isn't the type of place you want to stay at long enough to grow old. That fact comes in handy during our interrogation work.
108,Chiori,Charlotte,"One time, Charlotte came into the shop, hoping to do an interview with me. I told her there was no point, because there was nothing new to talk about. But just as she was leaving, a drunkard came stumbling into the shop and started causing trouble. She recorded the whole thing... What a fiasco. I've heard of journalists chasing leads, but now it seems news chases the journalists."
109,Chiori,Chevreuse,"Working with Chevreuse and talking with her are a cinch. So easy, in fact, that whenever I say goodbye to her and return to tending to my customers again, it takes me a moment to shift gears mentally."
110,Chiori,Emilie,"Emilie's perfumes are very popular. We have a business agreement where I ask her to deliver small quantities of perfume she's working on to Chioriya Boutique. I let Eloffe secretly spray the perfume in the fitting room, and then I'll let her know any feedback I get from the customers. Even after all this time, I've never once had a customer ever say that my fitting room smelled strange. In fact, they usually come one after another to ask where they can buy the fragrance. Out of curiosity, I always buy a bottle when she brings them to sell in her shop. I have to say that such fragrances which can always bring a sense of refreshment are truly works of art."
111,Chiori,Kamisato Ayaka,"If I wasn't always slipping away to go play when I was a child, I probably would never have had the chance to meet the young lady of the Kamisato Clan. There was one time when I climbed my way into the Kamisato Clan's courtyard, and her Temari just happened to roll over towards the wall. I could tell that she was both surprised and happy to see me. We played together and chatted for quite some time, but I was discovered in the end. And so, our brief friendship came to an end as I was kicked off the premises."
112,Chiori,Kirara,"While I was still in Inazuma, there was a cat with green eyes that always liked to follow me whenever I went out into the wild in search of inspiration. The kitty seemed to be very interested in the colors and patterns of the fabric I was carrying. She would even come up and rub her head against my legs when she was in a good mood.Later, I recognized those green eyes again, but on a girl with two tails. The way she gazed at new and intriguing things still had not changed after so many years."
113,Chiori,Lynette,"The magician's assistant sure doesn't say much, but I know she trusts me. You know, I sure get a lot of love from cats..."
114,Chiori,Lyney,"I can't make a hat that could hide secrets, but it seems Lyney can enchant his hat to do just that... I'm a little curious about how it feels to wear a hat full of so many tricks and secrets like his. As for me, I don't need the burden of all that, it's easiest to just say what's on my mind."
115,Chiori,Navia,"She used to beg me to help her design all kinds of strange things. For example, little crowns for every handle on a ship's helm... I couldn't help but roll my eyes at her request, and tell her that the most I would do is design her hat like a boat.Those who say I'm ahead of my time have clearly never spoken to her."
116,Chiori,Wriothesley,"Yes. Some of my friends and partners have mentioned him to me before. I admire his skills at management and diplomacy, but I certainly have no intention of changing my way of doing things."
117,Chongyun,Hu Tao,"The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a reputable institution that acts with integrity. But whenever I see that cheeky smile that says, ""It's nothing you exorcists need to worry about,"" it just makes my blood boil... Whoa, deep breaths, Chongyun. Stay calm."
118,Chongyun,Qiqi,"She looks like a zombie, but as an exorcist, I feel there's... something different about her. Hmm, her name is also absent from all the praised names I've seen... Where exactly does she fit in among the deities?"
119,Chongyun,Shenhe,"The elders in my clan have mentioned her before. The fate of her family... *sigh* It's something we can all sympathize with. I originally thought we would be able to bring back a long-lost relative back into our clan. The elders were overjoyed too, when they heard she was alive — they even prepared gifts for her, and picked an auspicious day for a grand reunion. What we hadn't counted on was that most of the time, she's extremely difficult to track down. Wait a minute, based on our relative positions in the family tree, does that mean I... There's no way I'd have to call her ""Auntie Shenhe""... right?"
120,Chongyun,Xiangling,"Xiangling's cooking is universally praised, but I personally don't touch any of her spicy dishes. Why? Oh, you know — just, uh... personal preference, that's all. I mean, come on, Mushroom Slime Stew... Does that sound appetizing to you?"
121,Chongyun,Xiao,"The Conqueror of Demons himself has defended Liyue side-by-side with we exorcists for generations, day after day, night after night. I have the utmost respect for Adeptus Xiao. It's just... Why must he be so disparaging toward us? He says our repertoire is lacking and our power is trivial. I'm sorry, but I just can't accept that."
122,Chongyun,Xingqiu,"I do admire Xingqiu for his devotion to chivalry and his martial arts proficiency. However — I must warn you that he definitely has a mean side, too. If you find that you fall foul of any of his antics, come to me and we'll form a ""Victims of Xingqiu"" alliance. There is strength in numbers."
123,Chongyun,Xinyan,"I avoid Xinyan's performances like the plague. That heated atmosphere... Even if you don't intend to get involved, it still... Let's just say that it gets me all hot and bothered."
124,Chongyun,Yelan,"I met her once, back when I'd just become an exorcist. I'd taken a commission to perform an exorcism in someone's home, and was just leaving at the end when I ran into her. She wrote my name down in a booklet — I guess she just wanted to confirm I wasn't doing anything suspicious... Anyway, it was just that one time, I never saw her again after that.Now that I think about it, it's probably because the sight of me meditating motionless must be pretty boring to watch. Not exactly suspicious."
125,Chongyun,Zhongli,"That Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor seems to be quite an incredible man. Just think, common folk might gang up to commit a murder, we exorcists vanquish demons — but he alone buries the bodies of the adepti."
126,Clorinde,Charlotte,"Charlotte is one of the more tactful journalists out there. I don't have anything negative to say about her.Unlike some, she doesn't ambush me with her Kamera on my way to work, or follow me to the coffee shop to report on what I'm drinking today... And most commendably of all, she is well aware that I do not do interviews and doesn't nag me about it continuously."
127,Clorinde,Chevreuse,"Ah yes, Captain Chevreuse. That's a name I've heard before. She has been landed with lawsuits on several occasions, after being accused of using excessive force when arresting culprits. She refuted the allegations just as forcefully during her testimony, leaving the plaintiff speechless. I think she's outstanding."
128,Clorinde,Chiori,"I've bought clothes from her store before. They're good quality. But most of the time, I prefer to wear my work uniform. Partly because it serves to clearly communicate my identity, and partly because I like things that are familiar. Just like my sword, this uniform is familiar and functional — I have no desire to change it."
129,Clorinde,Clorinde,"Every newspaper is plagued by reporting that is neither particularly fair, nor remotely just. Some writers allow their views to be swayed by personal connections and promises of Mora.If you want to find out the truth of a situation, the best way is to go to the people directly involved. Ask your own questions, and come to your own conclusions.At the very least, don't let other people's deceitful tongues serve as a substitute for your own brain.
My choice of weapons follows the Marechaussee Hunter tradition. A Musket to chase away my prey, and a sword to deliver it a fatal strike.In duels, of course, I typically only use my sword. Once you set foot in the Duelists' Ring, there is nowhere to run, and therefore no need to chase you away.
A Champion Duelist's job is not that complicated. In fact, you could say it's one of the simplest jobs there is. Defeat your opponent, as requested by the Trial Court. That's all there is to it....Perhaps that's why some people colloquially refer to me as an ""executioner.""
I always do what I can to ensure every duel is a fair fight. If my opponent has impaired vision, I cover my eyes. If their mobility is limited, I restrict my range of movement. Whatever happens, every duel I participate in must be fair.
I've lost count of how many times I've had people surrender right before the duel begins. When someone lacks the courage even to draw their weapon, I'm inclined to think that whatever grievance and claims of reputational damage brought them to this point are just the skewed opinions of a self-serving individual.Long before they face me, they are the architects of their own defeat. I needn't make a move when someone is a prisoner of their own soul.
Have you ever seen a guilty person on trial? In my experience, they always twist the truth in an effort to protest their innocence. Violence is explained away as virtue, and evil as good... But whatever their excuse, it always ends the same way: ""It was a momentary lapse of judgement, but anyone else in my position would have done the same thing, so don't single me out for punishment.""They seek to hide their own foulness by smearing it on everyone else too.Their lies must be demolished, and the court cleansed of their filth. And that is exactly why I became a Champion Duelist.
I've seen many people seek compassion from the court. No disrespect to them, but they're looking in the wrong place.The court is a place of impartial justice. And justice... must always remain indifferent, or it cannot prevail.Justice is too easily led astray once human emotion enters the mix. If impartial judgment were to give way to vindictive punishment, vindictiveness at the hand of the court would be every bit as cruel as the crimes perpetrated by lawbreakers.
Unlike my work as a duelist, being a Game Master in Tabletop Troupe gives me the freedom to stay outside of the story itself. and observe people's reactions without getting personally involved in all the drama. I create and control the world in which they operate... Hmm? Like watching a caged animal caught on a hunt? That's an interesting angle... I'd never thought of it like that before. But I would never give the players a hard time — I just want them to enjoy the story. So it's quite different from hunting.
I do hope those journalists stop harassing me while I'm just trying to enjoy a cup of coffee, buy a bunch of flowers, or read a book. Otherwise, I may have to file a lawsuit to make an example of one or two of them. If they request a duel, I'll make them bring their Kamera, and in the interest of fairness, I too will bring only a Kamera."
130,Clorinde,Emilie,"I've heard that she's a perfumer. I've also heard a little about her true profession. I saw her out on the street once. She was stroking a little dog, and had a gentle smile on her face. We nodded at each other, then each went our separate ways."
131,Clorinde,Freminet,"One day, I received a parcel containing a miniature mechanical toy and a thank-you card. The toy was exquisitely made. I must thank Mr. Freminet in person when I get the opportunity... Hm? The opportunity may be hard to come by, you say? Very well, then I too shall write a thank-you card. Please pass it on to him for me."
132,Clorinde,Furina,"In the past, I always stood behind her at tea parties, sword at the ready. But now, I get to sit at the table and enjoy the tea and treats along with her.I'm now beginning to understand why she complains all the time about how hard it is to maintain her physique."
133,Clorinde,Lyney,"I have to applaud the great magician for the level of professionalism he displays in his craft. If I ever have the time, I would very much like to enjoy one of his shows as a regular audience member."
134,Clorinde,Navia,"Navia's been in a good mood lately. It seems like every other day she's asking me to join her at Tabletop Troupe for a new script.The story is always so different. Save for the few times when I've taken the role of Game Master, I often play in character and join her on the adventure. But I do try to avoid playing any characters from the court, so as not to make the atmosphere too serious..."
135,Clorinde,Neuvillette,"No one is in any doubt as to the Iudex's authority. He always delivers a fair verdict — and when necessary, I will reiterate the fairness of this verdict with my sword."
136,Clorinde,Sigewinne,"Miss Sigewinne is an excellent nurse, equally adept at treating the injured and comforting the distressed. I'm sure that her kind and loving nature brings out what little good there may be even in the vilest offenders of the Fortress of Meropide.And maybe that just might serve as enough of a motivation for them to change their ways."
137,Clorinde,Wriothesley,"Managing the Fortress of Meropide is no mean feat. Wriothesley is undoubtedly a highly capable person if he can maintain relative stability in a place like that.I highly suspect that he keeps quiet about some of the methods he uses, but there's no way we can know."
138,Collei,Amber,"Amber is amazing. She's friendly and has tons of enthusiasm, plus she's really brave and always does the right thing... She's the person I admire most of all! She's like a cozy fire that makes everyone around her feel warm. There's no way I'd be where I am today without her... So much time has gone by — I bet she's even more cool and confident than ever these days! Who knows if I'll ever be able to match her."
139,Collei,Cyno,"Um... I'd rather not talk about him, if that's okay? Oh, no — the General Mahamatra isn't a bad guy or anything. Matter of fact, I have him to thank for bringing me back from Mondstadt to Sumeru and finding me a safe place to stay. It's just that... whenever I'm reminded of the sealing process just before leaving Mondstadt... ooh... the back of my neck starts hurting again..."
140,Collei,Dori,"I ran into her once on forest ranger duty. She pulled out a bottle of fruit juice from her bag that looked really tasty, as if she somehow knew I was thirsty... Fortunately, Master was there, and he stopped me from spending all of my hard-earned Mora in a moment of weakness..."
141,Collei,Faruzan,"Um... To be honest, I don't really know how to handle people like Madam Faruzan... She's always saying that I'm a hardworking student and eager to learn, but that's because I have to be! I'm a slow learner, so I have to put in the extra effort. Oh, there was a time when I accidentally saw her research journal — only for a second, though. It was all written in old script, and I couldn't even make out half of it... Definitely the scariest book in Teyvat!"
142,Collei,Fischl,"...""Prinzessin der Verurteilung""? ...Mmm, nope, sorry. I wasn't in Mondstadt for very long, so I didn't hear of her. That name, though... *grimace*... Ahem, nothing."
143,Collei,Kaeya,"How's everyone in Mondstadt, are they good? I caused so much trouble back then, I sometimes wonder if I should make some time to go back there and apologize... Hmm, but what if I ran into the Cavalry Captain, and he started teasing me? ...Yeah, there's no rush, maybe I'll leave it a while longer."
144,Collei,Kaveh,"The General Mahamatra once brought him to our place for a meal. From the moment the fruit arrived on the table, he ranted non-stop about his difficult and stubborn roommate for the entire meal. We didn't get a single word in the whole time. We just nodded along and tried to stifle our laughter. It took a lot of effort."
145,Collei,Lisa,"After all this time, Lisa still calls me ""Little Collei"" when she writes to me. I feel like by now she... hmm? She calls you ""cutie""? Hahaha... Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, um... but I must say, that makes me feel a lot better."
146,Collei,Nahida,"The Dendro Archon... When I was a kid, there were so many times when I just wanted to scream out to the gods and ask them why, why did I have to go through so much pain...? *sigh* But, for all I know, maybe the gods feel just as helpless about everything they have to endure as I did back then."
147,Collei,Nilou,"She seems a little absent-minded. If she ever comes to perform around Gandharva Ville, I'm worried she'll end up wandering off into the forest and getting lost... So I'll have to watch out for her, as a responsible trainee forest ranger should."
148,Collei,Tighnari,"Although Master can be quite stern and is always criticizing adventurers for carelessly eating poisonous mushrooms, he is actually a gentle soul. He's so patient when he tutors me, and he even reads out letters from Mondstadt for me. I've always been very grateful to him."
149,Cyno,Alhaitham,"I don't really like people who are too smart. They think they can control everything, and constantly venture to the fringes of danger. But Alhaitham is one of the more reliable ones. In most cases, he is actually in control of things and has the ability to avert potential disaster."
150,Cyno,Collei,"I once helped Collei seal away the god's remains in her body, but the process was an unthinkably painful one. To many, enduring that kind of pain would be a prospect more terrifying than death, so it was very admirable that she was able to persevere through it all."
151,Cyno,Faruzan,"I've carefully browsed through the case files regarding Faruzan's disappearance. At the time, I thought maybe she had been conducting some kind of dangerous research, but once I met her in person, I completely abandoned that idea. Though it might be a little hard for me to get along with her, she mostly reminds me of a kindly and chatty parent. She is considerate of others, and would never do anything imprudent."
152,Cyno,Kaveh,"Tighnari and Collei never said it to my face, but they found Kaveh's personal anecdotes far more entertaining than the jokes I had prepared... I could see it on their faces. Hmm? What did I think about that? Well, I thought it was funny that they could laugh at such a situation."
153,Cyno,Lisa,"Of course I know about Lisa, we once both studied under the same sage. As General Mahamatra, I've seen many tragedies befall those seeking knowledge too assiduously, so it's easy for me to understand her decision."
154,Cyno,Nahida,"Commenting on a god might be overstepping my position a little... But when I was working with her, I personally witnessed her wisdom, courage, and determination. Compared with those sages who constantly undermined and criticized her without a shred of evidence, I think I can provide a more reliable assessment: She is an exceptional deity who is worthy of everyone's respect."
155,Cyno,Nilou,I can sense her enthusiasm and passion for dancing — it has become an integral part of her being. I hope that she will always be able to use the art she loves to bring happiness to other people.
156,Cyno,Tighnari,"Tighnari is different from other scholars I've met. He has the same wholehearted dedication to knowledge, but he will never cross the most important boundaries. Some scholars see themselves as gods within their own laboratories, but not Tighnari — he has always shown the same respect for every form of life. I've heard that he even declined a position in the Akademiya, and I support his decision.
Tighnari once told me not to tell jokes at the dinner table, insisting that my jokes weren't funny at all. I did not share his opinion, so I told three of my best jokes in a row, and explained the premise of each in great detail. By the time I was done talking, my food was cold."
157,Dehya,Alhaitham,"He offered me a position in the Akademiya once. I declined — working in a place like that would bore me to death. He, on the other hand, is exactly the kind of person I can imagine working there... always talking in long, convoluted sentences, and in that snooty tone... Tsk."
158,Dehya,Candace,"Ah, Candace... I love her to bits, but she can be as stubborn as a Sumpter Beast sometimes. I keep telling her she oughtta cut herself some slack, take some time off, maybe go take a walk around Sumeru City, buy herself some nice new clothes or jewelry... but she always says the same old thing: She can't bear to leave the village unprotected. I dunno how many times she's turned me down now. Ugh, if I really can't persuade her, I guess I'll just have to watch the village for her sometime, and get one of my Eremite girls to take her shopping..."
159,Dehya,Cyno,"The General Mahamatra? Doesn't suffer fools gladly, and certainly doesn't beat around the bush. Having seen the way he works, he gets a thumbs up from me."
160,Dehya,Dori,"Ah, the famous merchant. I've heard that her prices aren't cheap, but is it true that she can get a hold of anything you want? Hahaha, then I should start talking to her, 'cause uh... some of the supplies we mercs need are impossible to get anywhere else on the market, no matter what you're willing to pay."
161,Dehya,Layla,"Ahh, the sleepy girl, yeah, I think I remember her. I ran into her once at an oasis on the outskirts of the desert. She was out with some group from the Akademiya doing astronomical observations, or something. I wasn't really paying attention. ...Huh? Candace... what now? Emissary from the stars? The heck is that all about? Almost sounds like she didn't wake up before getting out of bed."
162,Dehya,Nahida,"Hmph... You know, I always thought the Akademiya's worst were just a bunch of greedy dogs, each fighting for their slice of the pie... Nope. Turns out they were a vicious pack of wolves who betrayed the whole nation. If you want my opinion... Lesser Lord Kusanali was too good to them. Those animals didn't deserve her mercy — she should've broken every single bone in their bodies! Instead, they got a nice little vacation in the rainforest... To say they got off lightly is just putting it mildly."
163,Dehya,Nilou,"Now that the whole saga with the Akademiya's over, I guess she can finally dance as much as she wants. She offered me some of her face powder last time I saw her, but I didn't have the time to go fetch it. So I told her to give it to Candace instead. Hmm... I wonder how she's liking it? I need to go check sometime..."
164,Dehya,Sethos,"Oh yeah, I only found out about him being from the Temple of Silence recently, too. Ahh, sorry, no — I'm no expert in mysterious organizations like that. Seen him a few times in the desert though. He's very down-to-earth. Once when my guys got into some trouble in the desert, he was kind enough to share his drinking water with them. Nice guy."
165,Dehya,Tighnari,"Hahaha, the one that got away... I came thiiis close to doing a job for that guy. A contact put us in touch — I was supposed to be his guide through the desert for some kind of investigation. But then it got canceled out of the blue, no idea why. Wait, actually... I think there was something about him not being good with the heat? I'm not sure, but it could have been that..."
166,Diluc,Diona,Diona's attitude towards me is... how should I put it? Rather rigid. I've yet to find the opportunity to speak with her properly. I'm not sure if it's an issue with my family line or— Oh? It's not? She simply despises alcohol? Huh... I never thought I'd come across another bartender like myself in Mondstadt.
167,Diluc,Eula,"Ah, yes... I've heard about her. She has her own convictions. Her determination to liberate herself from the shackles of her clan is praiseworthy. But, she's... joined the Knights of Favonius."
168,Diluc,Jean,"Trifling matters can become Jean's greatest enemy.
Her unparalleled sense of responsibility is the sole reason why she still hasn't found her true calling."
169,Diluc,Kaeya,Kaeya? You can only trust half of what he says... at best.
170,Diluc,Lisa,I believe Lisa has the potential to become the most reliable of the knights. If she's willing.
171,Diluc,Mona,"The land of Mondstadt, by the Anemo Archon's grace, is bountiful. I see no need for the harvest forecasts of astrologers."
172,Diluc,Varka,"Grand Master Varka... While I understand his disposition, I can make no sense of his actions. ...I—I've said too much already. I've long since left the Knights of Favonius. Forget I said anything."
173,Diona,Albedo,Alchemy genius? Hmm... I wonder if he knows of a way to finally help me make a drink that people don't like?
174,Diona,Barbara,"How come all my fans are drunk middle-aged men, while Barbara's are all young people...? Hmph! So stupid. Forget it!"
175,Diona,Diluc,"Diluc... I can't stand him! If there was no Diluc, there would be no Mondstadt wine industry; if there was no Mondstadt wine industry, Daddy wouldn't drink; and if Daddy didn't drink... he would keep me company. Ohhhh..."
176,Diona,Jean,"Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius... A rare, mature adult who doesn't drink... But perhaps a little too earnest, cause is it just me, or are the Knights overdoing it a bit on protecting me?"
177,Diona,Kaeya,"How is it that even a captain is a disgusting boozehound! You know, that guy who's got that laugh! He downs drink after drink. Ugh!"
178,Diona,Klee,"Every time Klee wants to play with me, I take her somewhere far from the tavern. Alcohol and explosives... yeah, that's a dangerous combination! I mean, do I want to destroy the wine industry of Mondstadt? Yes, but not in that sense!"
179,Diona,Lisa,"Lisa is so nice and gentle! But... how can such a gentle person also be a regular drinker!? Ohhhh... Why!? ...There's really no hope for Mondstadt, is there?"
180,Diona,Venti,"Venti? I'm not familiar with him... He's a bard? Oh, he must be that guy who sings tunes to entertain the drunkards. Well, then I don't like him, no no no..."
181,Diona,Xiangling,"Xiangling once gave me a ""so-awful-it-goes-with-nothing"" food combination she came up with, saying how it tasted absolutely terrible, blah blah blah... It didn't work, no use at all. All my little cat ears heard that night was ""One more cup of that good stuff!"" *sigh*"
182,Dori,Alhaitham,"He once came nosing around, asking my minions some questions to see what he could find out. Like I said, those Akademiya people are just pig-headed and dishonest. Why should I take the risk of others prying into my business? Right, my young apprentice?"
183,Dori,Alice,"Alice's range of eccentric novelties knows no end! Which makes her by far my best supplier, hehe. Ahem, now that I've told you my trade secret, I think you should catch up on your tuition fees, hmm? C'mon, pay up!"
184,Dori,Cyno,"You could say I know him. After all, I was the only merchant in all Sumeru who could acquire the full range of Genius Invokation TCG merch for him! Not bad, huh? I've gotta admit, it's pretty rare to see anyone from the Akademiya like him... independent and with a good head on his shoulders. Plus, he's never been one to haggle over prices."
185,Dori,Dehya,"I hire her to help escort my caravans from time to time. After all, she's got the muscle, and her price is reasonable. When it comes to cost-performance ratio, she's always the best pick."
186,Dori,Kaveh,"Ah yeah, he's one of the Kshahrewar people that I work with. Unlike the more closed-minded people at the Akademiya, he actually has his own dreams that he's fighting for. I, for one, really respect that. I secretly lent him some Mora — and I mean a LOT of Mora — to build my Palace of Alcazarzaray. One thing's for sure — without Dori the benevolent benefactor, Kaveh would not be where he is today, hehe."
187,Dori,Kirara,"She delivered several orders to me when I was stocking up on goods from outside of Sumeru. Her service is great, and her prices are low. Oh, I think she's into pretty accessories, and I happen to have some handmade Sumeru specialties on sale! Wanna buy some as a gift for her? I can give you a discount!"
188,Dori,Nahida,"In Sumeru, Lesser Lord Kusanali has very few believers. Hmm? Am I one? Heh, if she's willing to pay me, I'd be her loyal believer for all eternity."
189,Dori,Nilou,"She's a good dancer, but definitely not making the most of her time by staying in Sumeru... I mean, it's a complete waste of her talent. If I took her on tour across all Teyvat, do you have any idea how much Mora I'd rake in?"
190,Dori,Tighnari,"He loves learning as much as I love Mora. I heard he makes a lot of little interesting gadgets, but he refuses to partner with me to mass produce them. He always says he's too busy with work, but really it's just an excuse. sigh A shame, really... We could make an absolute fortune!"
191,Dori,Zhongli,"Before Rex Lapis parted from this world, I'd say a little prayer every morning: ""O great God of Wealth up above, please bless my day with more Mora to love."" But uh, now, I guess I just pray to myself... ""O divine Dori right here and now, please bless my day with more Mora to count!"" Hehe."
192,Eula,Amber,"Amber's someone who thinks for herself. On the day I first joined the Knights, she cleaned my dormitory and gave me a tour of the headquarters, and she's helped me with a myriad of other things in the time since. Now, everyone looks at me like the older sibling who needs the younger sibling to do everything for them! Hmph. For this, she must pay!"
193,Eula,Barbara,"Everyone loves her. What's her secret? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from her... Hmm, or maybe not. I can't imagine a ""Shining Idol"" would want anything to do with a descendant of a depraved dynasty."
194,Eula,Diluc,"I don't get along with some of the knights, and he doesn't think much of them in general, so you'd think that would make us allies. But the way he always acts so aloof — he's even worse than Acting Grand Master Jean. I want nothing to do with him."
195,Eula,Diona,"Diona? She's a miracle worker when it comes to making cocktails, and to my surprise, we get along really well. She infiltrated a tavern with the hopes of tearing down the wine industry, while I infiltrated the knights to exact my revenge on them. A kindred spirit it seems..."
196,Eula,Jean,"The Acting Grand Master's family and mine are sworn enemies. But she draws a clear line between professional and personal matters. She saw I was capable, admitted me into the Knights, and gave me lots of opportunities. So, when the time comes for vengeance, I'll afford her a reasonably soft landing."
197,Eula,Lisa,"She's so annoying. She must have read thousands of books... could even be tens of thousands. Meaning, she can effortlessly recall any number of vile tales about the Lawrence Clan's corruption off the top of her head, accurate down to the exact date. Logically speaking, she'd be the perfect person to talk to about someone I'd like to track down, but... swallowing my pride would be too great a challenge."
198,Eula,Mika,"When Mika was assigned to the Reconnaissance Company, I thought that he'd only last a few days, just like the others before him. But he surprised me. He never made a peep, but he completed all of his tasks quite admirably. He even volunteered to run errands for me, and assist with communication... Hmph... I don't know who is going around telling people that I need looking after...
Mika's personality hasn't changed one bit since he's been out with the expedition, though his abilities have improved significantly. The Grand Master is clearly making sure nobody neglects their training... Hmm? Mika's unaware of his own improvement? It must be one of his blind spots... or perhaps he's just being humble. Either way, things like this don't escape me. I know my team."
199,Eula,Mona,"We're not so different, you and I. We're both outsiders in Mondstadt. Difference is, Mondstadt welcomes you with open arms, but they treat me with hostility and suspicion..."
200,Eula,Razor,"Free from social mores and other people's opinions, and no family obligations... Must be an easy life!"
201,Eula,Sucrose,"The alchemist... She once gave me a piece of equipment and told me it would help me infiltrate an Abyss Order camp undetected. In reality, it caused a huge explosion that completely blew my cover and before I knew it I was being accosted by 13 mitachurls... Afterwards, I marched straight back there, intending to make her pay for what she had done, but when I saw how panicked and sheepish she looked, and watched her post her results on the wall with the word ""Fail,"" I couldn't bring myself to go through with it... After all, I didn't get hurt, just a little disheveled... and a little humiliated."
202,Eula,Varka,"Hmph, the Grand Master... He doesn't like to beat around the bush and has no care for rumors or trivial matters. A good guy, I guess. I sparred with him once, which ended in a tie, but his relaxed expression and leisurely attitude clearly indicated that he had been holding back the whole time... Such indignity! I will not let it go!"
203,Eula,Venti,"I heard that bard sing a few songs about the Lawrence Clan... They were lighthearted and funny stories that mocked the clan in a way I've never heard anyone else do. Even I couldn't help but burst out laughing... And for this, he must pay!"
204,Eula,Yanfei,"This one's a long story... We ended up saving her life once when we were tracking down a batch of dangerous cargo that belonged to the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order had packed it up like regular cargo and wanted it shipped from Dornman Port to Liyue Harbor. She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo — and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate.
We've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation. A few of the Knights would do well to take a leaf out of her book... Also, with her smarts, maybe she could help me track someone down that I've been looking for... She does owe me a favor from last time, after all."
205,Faruzan,Collei,"Ah, Collei... She's respectful toward her elders, diligent, and has a hard-working attitude — truly the perfect student! Children like her deserve all the affection and praise. Tighnari really has no reason to be as strict as he has been. Hmph... I need to find a way to win her over... Ahem! What I meant to say was, as a senior scholar, I should find ways to improve the learning environment of younger students."
206,Faruzan,Cyno,"Cyno's jokes are composed using modern words and language patterns, but I still struggle to decipher any hidden meaning from his grammar and prose... Huh? It's all just literal meanings and homophones? Really...? Then, those jokes don't have any substance at all..."
207,Faruzan,Kaveh,"Kaveh's a good kid with great potential. I had a casual chat with him once about some principles of mechanism construction. Hmm, how should I put it... He's too much of an artsy romantic, but at least he has some original ideas, which is rare nowadays. I've heard that he's fallen on some hard times, so I'm planning to invite him out for a good meal once my funding gets approved. It'll happen soon, promise."
208,Faruzan,Layla,"Sometimes, she'll lower her head and keep her distance when she sees me. However, she's all smiles and greetings at night... I don't quite get her. Anyway, most kids in Rtawahist are geniuses. A quirk or two isn't anything to concern myself with."
209,Faruzan,Nahida,"Knowledge is naturally something that cannot be limited or restrained. It's like how Kshahrewar can utilize Haravatat's research findings. All scholars will be grateful to Lesser Lord Kusanali for releasing the Akademiya— no, the entire City of Wisdom from the shackles of selfish desires. All who thirst for knowledge are now afforded the opportunity to search for treasures in the vast sea of knowledge."
210,Faruzan,Nilou,"I remember her; she's a courteous girl. I've only been to the Grand Bazaar a few times, but she's already remembered my name and face, and she's even tried to get the others to stop arguing with me. She really gets it! All youngsters should be more like her."
211,Faruzan,Sethos,"Oh? You mean the new arrival? Yes, didn't he show up at the perfect time! I still don't know which Darshan he belongs to, but I seem to run into him all the time these days: out on the streets, in shops, at restaurants... It's like he's everywhere at once. The way he nods his head when he talks, it's like... oh, I don't know, like... a little puppy, yes. Eloquent young fellow, too. Seems like a good egg. Anyway, are you acquainted with him? You must encourage him to enroll in my classes. Tell him Madam Faruzan will take good care of him."
212,Faruzan,Tighnari,"One of my favorite projects is researching rainforest ruins. Ah right, I should ask Tighnari to come with me next time. It's always fun to travel with the living copy of the Rainforest Survival Guide. I must say, even though I've been around for more than a hundred years, he's seen far more varieties of fungi than I've had the chance to taste..."
213,Fischl,Bennett,"Fischl: Ah, the ill-starred young man... My Auge der Verurteilung has seen with unmistakable clarity how his heart ails at being forsaken by the world—Oz: Someone needs to keep an eye on the unlucky fellow."
214,Fischl,Kaeya,"Fischl: His nature is obscure, his fate a mystery, and his speech a vexing tapestry woven of both fact and fiction... Perhaps he and I share the burden of mystical sight...Oz: Or perhaps he's secretly an actual pirate?"
215,Fischl,Lisa,"Fischl: The magus-custodian of books, gatekeeper of universal knowledge... Win her trust, and one may yet gain access to a vast repository of wisdom...Oz: She means as long as you return your first few library books on time, you'll never have any trouble borrowing a book again."
216,Fischl,Mona,"Fischl: Aha, yes, Mona, the mighty astrologer... Mona, who once had the vanity to probe the fate of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung herself! She wound up a trembling wreck, overborne and overmastered.Oz: The poor lass was trying desperately not to laugh. It was no easy task."
217,Fischl,Rosaria,"Fischl: One finds Sister Rosaria to be a most devout believer in the Anemo Archon.Oz: ...""Devout believer,"" mein Fräulein?Fischl: Indeed! One night, I heard her invoking the name of the Archon thus in another's presence: ""May you be struck down in the name of Lord Bartabos!"" One presumed that she was leading a prayer."
218,Freminet,Arlecchino,"""Father"" doesn't like it when children cry. ""Father"" says tears are the product of emotion and weakness. So when ""Father"" scolds me, I hold it in until I'm underwater, where no one can hear me cry. At least I have the Romaritime Flowers to keep me company.
When I was little, I was taught that we should be ready to give our lives for our family. But when ""Father"" took control, this philosophy changed. ""Father"" said that every one of us is important, and we have to value our own lives, be our strongest selves, and stand on our own two feet in this world... But actually, all of that's much harder than just following orders."
219,Freminet,Charlotte,"For some reason, Charlotte never believes me when I say I'm just an ordinary diver. She's convinced that my past is full of news stories waiting for her to dig up... Am I really that bad of a liar?"
220,Freminet,Chevreuse,"I hear that Chevreuse is a regular customer of Beaumont Workshop. She always purchases the most expensive and advanced components for her musket. If I make enough Mora, maybe one day I can afford to upgrade Pers's components."
221,Freminet,Clorinde,"I owe Clorinde my life, but she says she doesn't want anything from me in return... It's not a nice feeling, having put someone out so much, and only being able to offer empty thank-yous in return."
222,Freminet,Furina,"Uh... I'm in no position to give a well-rounded opinion on the Hydro Archon, so... I'll pass. I mean, I've only seen her a few times... so I'm sure I have a somewhat skewed view of her.
...Okay fine. I've seen what the Hydro Archon's like when she's sitting in the audience. In my view, she's a very charismatic speaker, but it's her silences that intrigue me more. Her eyes... they're like the darkness at the bottom of the ocean. Hiding a deep secret, afraid of anyone ever getting close to her... Ah! Sorry, I... I let my imagination get the better of me."
223,Freminet,Lynette,"If you assigned Lyney and Lynette with the same mission, they'd both do an outstanding job. But not me. Lynette is always comforting me, saying that everyone has their strengths, and how everyone relies on me to fix things around the house when they break down... If only I was half as good at anything else."
224,Freminet,Lyney,"At home, Lyney's always showing me his magic tricks. Whenever I smile, he grins excitedly and says the audience is definitely going to love this one... Do I really smile so rarely?
Lyney is our team leader, and acts like everyone's older brother... But I can tell that he puts on a brave face sometimes. I tried to talk to him about it once — told him that he doesn't need to wear a mask all the time. But he denied it, and we ended up having an argument... Since then, I've never brought it up with him again."
225,Freminet,Navia,"Lyney told me everything. I'm so grateful to you and Navia for your warmth and generosity. Please pass on my thanks when you see her... Huh? Tell her myself? ...Uh, I, uh... Ooh, I've suddenly got stomach cramps — sorry, gotta dash."
226,Freminet,Neuvillette,"One day when I surfaced after a dive, the Chief Justice was just standing there alone on the beach. I don't know whether he had something on his mind, or was just enjoying the view... Obviously, I didn't ask. I only locked eyes with him for a split-second before disappearing back underwater. Thinking back, I must have looked so guilty... *sigh*"
227,Furina,Arlecchino,"The Knave? W-Who's that? Oh... Uh, I'd already forgotten about her... Keeping such a terrible figure like her in your mind will only give you nightmares."
228,Furina,Charlotte,"I've often seen Charlotte busily running back and forth lately. She still seems to be hoping to arrange an exclusive interview with me. No matter how many times I refuse, she still hasn't given up. To be honest, her persistence made me angry at first... but then she told me with a resolute look in her eyes that she wanted to let people understand the real Furina, and that she believed people would understand my troubles. I don't know how to respond to her kind intentions... I suppose she might be right, but I'm just not ready yet..."
229,Furina,Clorinde,"As I remember, Clorinde isn't very talkative, but she has stood by me and protected me on several occasions, so I trust her very much. Hmm... I do miss her ever so slightly, but I don't have any real reason to see her now. Oh, right! I should invite her to my next tea party!"
230,Furina,Lynette; Lyney,"Of course I know Lyney and Lynette. I used to frequently attend their magic shows. Though they're very popular, they're still much less popular than me. Only my performances would draw a completely sold-out crowd... even standing tickets would be out. But now... Uh... I've already decided to hang up my acting career, so it's perfectly normal for my popularity to decline!"
231,Furina,Navia,"Have you tried Navia's macarons? I have to admit that her skills in dessert-making are comparable to mine. The design she paints on the macarons is so cute, don't you think? Not to mention the texture and sweetness... They truly are a work of art! How does she do it? Does it really all boil down to talent? Ugh, I can't believe I'm feeling a little jealous... I'll have to ask her for some tips next time!
She's a very strong person. Strong people will always manage to keep themselves together no matter what happens, acting like everything is fine. Doing so prevents other people around them from needlessly bearing additional pressure. I saw the duel between Callas and Clorinde... and I can say that in this respect, Navia is becoming more and more like her father."
232,Furina,Neuvillette,"I'm very grateful to Neuvillette for all the hard work he's done for Fontaine in the past few centuries. It seems he doesn't intend to investigate my crimes of deceiving the people. Anyway, we're no longer working in tandem, and it's been a long time since I've been to the Palais Mermonia. I imagine that this is good for both of us, right?"
233,Furina,Wriothesley,"I haven't communicated with him much, but Neuvillette claims he's trustworthy, so I suppose he must be a good person. Oh, come to think of it, I've received some tea from Wriothesley before and it was exquisite!"
234,Gaming,Baizhu,"Working as a guard and doing Wushou Dancing means I have a pretty injury-prone lifestyle. Good thing is, Dr. Baizhu's medicine is always there to save the day. Seriously, it's like the one thing people should pack before going on a long journey or family vacation. My workmates at the Secure Transport Agency always get me to bring some back for them when I come to Liyue Harbor."
235,Gaming,Charlotte,"Oh, yeah, yeah, the journalist, I know who you mean! All the Fontainians in Yilong Wharf read The Steambird, and sometimes I take a peekski too. Seems like all the best articles have her name on them. Wait! And you were on the front page once! That was you, right?"
236,Gaming,Chongyun,"I heard that guy's got a ""pure-yang spirit""? Where I'm from, we call that heatiness. Dude needs to drink more herbal teas, for real."
237,Gaming,Keqing,"It's all thanks to the Yuheng that we don't get so many bandits on the road between Liyue Harbor and Yilong Wharf anymore. She's the one who spearheaded the crackdown on all that. ...You think my job's at risk, huh? Haha, they ain't gonna get rid of me that easily. Sure, maybe there's no more bandits to fight, but you're always gonna need a strong pair of arms to lug the cargo around."
238,Gaming,Qiqi,"Ah, Qiqi, the lovable munchkin. She's convinced that all my accidents are due to stiff joints, so whenever I'm at Bubu Pharmacy stocking up on medicine, she makes me do some stretches with her to limber me up, haha. It's easy, wanna try? Ok, after me: One, two three, four; two, two, three, four..."
239,Gaming,Xiangling,"Pretty much everything Chef Xiangling cooks is a winner, but my favorite has to be her Black-Back Perch Stew. I always try to rinse off the molten lava sauce before each bite, but I'm still like ""ss, ah, ss, ah"" trying to cool my mouth down, hahaha! Worth every bite though, and they do generous portions — you can see why it's Wanmin's signature dish. I'll be back for my next fix soon!"
240,Gaming,Xianyun,"Aunty Xianyun always has my back. Once, she saw that my Wushou head was looking a little worse for wear, and instantly said she could make, like, ten more for me, all twice my size. She was pretty insistent — it took me forever to talk her down to just remodeling the one I already had... And boy, is this an improvement! It looks way more impressive, it's much lighter, and the lion blanket constantly rustles in the air like there's an adeptal wind making it dance. I couldn't be happier with it!"
241,Gaming,Xingqiu,"The Feiyun Commerce Guild's a longtime client of the Secure Transport Agency. The older brother's the one who usually takes care of business with us, but there was one time when Xingqiu piped up with a question for me. So I start rambling away, giving him all the routes and delivery dates for all their recent orders... Turns out all he wanted to know was when the Wanwen Bookhouse is getting their next delivery in, hahaha..."
242,Gaming,Xinyan,"Xinyan's music is fire! No pun intended. Man Chai goes crazy for it — always gets him moshing away like a mad gremlin. I'd love to do a joint show together one day. ""Roaring Beasts: A Rock 'N' Roll Wushou Dance."" Whaddya think, has it got legs?"
243,Gaming,Yun Jin,"Yun Jin's a huge inspiration to me! Everyone agrees that she's a fantastic singer, from the experts to the casual listener. Incredible. If the Mighty Mythical Beasts ever get half as successful as the Yun-Han Opera Troupe... don't pinch me, 'cause I won't wanna wake up!"
244,Gaming,Zhongli,"Mr. Zhongli seems like the kind of guy who had an expensive education. Seems like whenever I make a delivery to a teahouse or opera house, he's always there drinking tea, listening to the storyteller, and looking like the smartest guy in the room. Dude, I once overheard him talking to someone about tea — I was like, man, if he ever got talking to my dad, that conversation would go on all night..."
245,Ganyu,Beidou,"Recently, everyone in Yujing Terrace has been saying nasty things about the Crux Fleet. But in my personal opinion, Beidou's contribution to Liyue Harbor goes far beyond what those miserable rumor-loving heathens could even contemplate! ...Oops! I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite sure how that one slipped out..."
246,Ganyu,Keqing,"I cannot stand her disrespectful attitude towards Rex Lapis! But he says to me, ""Ganyu, this is just the kind of person Liyue needs in this day and age."" I guess I'm not smart enough, because I simply do not understand what he means by that. I think I need more life experience to become wise enough to comprehend his words.
She came to me recently to discuss the reopening of the Bishui trade route. She even asked me what Rex Lapis would do if it were him. Admittedly, what we came up with was not quite on par with what he would have chosen. But... seeing the way she kept starting her plan from scratch over and over again, I think I started to understand her a little bit."
247,Ganyu,Ningguang,"Each Tianquan adds their own interpretation and amendments to the founding laws of Liyue. The current one, Ningguang, does it with unmatched efficiency, but that efficacious manner of hers draws a great deal of criticism. I suppose it is always simpler to criticize than to tolerate."
248,Ganyu,Shenhe,"I actually don't know her all that well — I've only heard bits and pieces from Cloud Retainer. From what I've heard, she can be quite ferocious. Whenever her temper gets the better of her, she is likely to start obliterating her surroundings. I wonder if she's just... bored. Should... Should I recommend some work to keep her occupied?"
249,Ganyu,Xiangling,"Xiangling is a celebrity! Um, but... I try to avoid her restaurant. Just... because. No reason. ...Okay, fine. It's not a big secret anyway. It's because you can smell her cooking all the way from the other end of the street. And once you get a whiff, I mean, that's it. You're gone. Next thing you know, you're ordering your second, maybe third round... You just can't control it. Even though I only eat the vegetarian dishes, I don't know what it is. But that is not a road I want to go down again... Not after..."
250,Ganyu,Xianyun,"Cloud Retainer... Oh, I mean, Ms. Xianyun — we went shopping together a while back, but we ended up stopping at every single stall, and she wanted to inspect every item they sold before we could leave. When we finally remembered to get something to eat, it was already dark out. It really reminded me of the time I used to spend training in the mountains with her... Back then, time also seemed to pass in the blink of an eye..."
251,Ganyu,Xiao,"He seems like a bit of an outsider, socially. Probably just his personality... I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us..."
252,Ganyu,Xingqiu,"You mean the boy in the blue jacket from the Feiyun Commerce Guild? He's nothing like his father and brother, doesn't seem to care about the textile business at all. Seems it's because as far as he's concerned, there are more important things for him to be doing. Of course, I'm merely speculating..."
253,Ganyu,Yanfei,"Ah, Yanfei... Even back when she was an innocent little girl, she would tell me that ""you have to keep your promises to live a happy life."" Now, she's grown up to be a beautiful, graceful, and highly successful young woman. Although the work of a legal adviser is complicated, she always seems so carefree. This puts my mind at ease."
254,Ganyu,Yaoyao,"Yaoyao... Someone I know at the Ministry of Civil Affairs tasked me with keeping an eye on her in the city, making sure she doesn't try and sneak aboard the Crux... Oh, you want to know what the Ministry of Civil Affairs does? ...Who knows, am I right!? Heh... Who knows what they do? ...Not me..."
255,Ganyu,Yelan,"Even though Ms. Yelan is absent from work for the majority of the year, I'm sure Lady Ningguang must have her reasons for making exceptions for her. Of course, it wouldn't be my place to ask, so I don't know the details of their arrangement. I remember seeing her one day on my way back to Yuehai Pavilion, she was having breakfast with a group of people — they were all talking and laughing, eating, drinking tea... I must admit, I found myself feeling a little envious in that moment."
256,Ganyu,Zhongli,"I have absolute faith in Rex Lapis. It was only through his leadership that we were able to repel the monsters and subdue the sea creatures, and thus protect the peace of Liyue. The sight of him protecting the masses, and the memory of our centuries of camaraderie... I shall never forget it.
All of Rex Lapis' decisions prioritize the welfare of all life in Liyue. That's what I admire about him the most. I want to live up to the same standard... but it seems that the harder I try to follow in his footsteps, the more overwhelmed I get and the more mistakes I make..."
257,Gorou,Beidou,"Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to."
258,Gorou,Kaedehara Kazuha,"I've seen all kinds of wandering samurai before, and Kazuha is categorically a different breed from the others. He's like a gust of wind that sweeps through the land. Though he never stays for long, he is always able to contribute something to those who are around him. When I fought alongside him, I learned more about what it means to be truly carefree and without constraints. In any case, I think that Kazuha and I make a great team together!"
259,Gorou,Kamisato Ayaka,"The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her."
260,Gorou,Kujou Sara,"I have nothing good to say about the Shogun's Army, but Kujou Sara is perhaps the most honorable officer among their ranks. We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate."
261,Gorou,Raiden Shogun,"Grr, the Raiden Shogun... I could never bring myself to accept her past actions, no matter what her reasoning may have been. Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line."
262,Gorou,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"As the leader of Watatsumi Island, Her Excellency is responsible for assessing the scenario and formulating a plan. It is then my duty to put every detail of the plan into action and to keep the situation under control on the front line. We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory.
I have only the utmost respect for Her Excellency. Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much."
263,Gorou,Sayu,"Hmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then."
264,Gorou,Shikanoin Heizou,"You mean that sneaky detective that never seems to actually be working on a case? Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose."
265,Gorou,Yae Miko,"Oh, her... I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her..."
266,Hu Tao,Baizhu,"Baizhu? Ugh, that guy..."
267,Hu Tao,Beidou,"Beidou is well-known in Liyue. She doesn't know me, but that's cool, me just knowing about her is enough. Aw man... I really do wanna make friends with her."
268,Hu Tao,Chongyun,All yang and no yin? Who knew such people existed in this world.
269,Hu Tao,Keqing,"The Yuheng, Keqing... she's quite hard to talk to. She's so uptight, hehe... Really makes me wanna mess with her. She wouldn't knock me in the head with her sword though, right? Or would she...?"
270,Hu Tao,Ningguang,"Tianquan Ningguang... Well-off, a radiant gaze, exquisite face, in the know and capable of anything!"
271,Hu Tao,Qiqi,"Have you seen Qiqi? Tell me where she is, quickly. I need to go seal her away, hee-hee!"
272,Hu Tao,Shenhe,"She is quite the fascinating individual, completely different from anyone else I've encountered. Do you think if I started eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains every single day, I'd be able to look as pure and pristine as she does?"
273,Hu Tao,Xiangling,"Xiangling's a riot! Only a little ""boo"" and she jumps, she's so easy to scare! Being in the industry that I am, I just love these kinds of people the most. Gotta keep it in check though, in case Guoba ends up toasting me instead."
274,Hu Tao,Xiao,"What would I know of the adepti? Ai-yai-yai, that kind of stuff is top-secret! Don't come asking me about it!"
275,Hu Tao,Xingqiu,"I hear master Xingqiu is writing a book? Standard novella, or a ghost story? I think I should go tell him about all the things I run into — that'd make for a really good read!"
276,Hu Tao,Yun Jin,"Yun Jin always appears so graceful on formal occassions, but you'd be surprised how friendly she is in private! I made a bet with her once, and the loser had to sing lyrics of the winner's choice in their own singing style. My my, I wish you could have heard her operatic version of the Hilitune!"
277,Hu Tao,Zhongli,"Zhongli looks young, but his personality is a bit dusty. Knows everything, but doesn't fret over anything. Hmm... Couldn't be that he's a...Hehe, forget it, whatever."
278,Jean,Albedo,"Sometimes I feel that terms like ""genius"" were originally created for Albedo."
279,Jean,Amber,"I must say that Amber's development has impressed me recently. I hope that one day, her deeds will become the words of a bard's tale."
280,Jean,Barbara,"Barbara is a hard worker, but I feel she's too hard on herself sometimes... What? You ask me how I know all this? It's because the order also manages the Church."
281,Jean,Diluc,"Master Diluc has his reasons for being so critical of the Knights of Favonius. I am not proud of the way things went, but I cannot change the past. All I can do is keep working hard, in the hope he may one day see us in a better light... This is my duty.
Master Diluc is my senior, and I have the utmost respect for him. Though we have gone separate ways, I can sense we share the same strong commitment to protecting Mondstadt at all costs."
282,Jean,Eula,"Eula? Um... Please, do not hold her unfortunate background against her. The Knights of Favonius evaluate each person impartially. Eula has a clear sense of right and wrong and is more talented than most. The controversial statements that she makes from time to time are just a product of her personality. For instance, she always mentions wanting to challenge me, but I don't mind."
283,Jean,Kaeya,Is that right...? Kaeya also gave you some suggestions. He is an excellent knight after all — this is a fact no one can deny.
284,Jean,Klee,"Though it may be said that it is in a child's nature to play, the things Klee plays with are far from toys. I can never take my eyes off her."
285,Jean,Lisa,"When Lisa is around, I always have peace of mind."
286,Jean,Mika,"The Grand Master placed Mika on the front line of the expedition team not simply because he met the requirements of the mission — more importantly, he was impressed by Mika's hardworking and grounded nature. From my own perspective, I feel very honored to work with someone like him."
287,Jean,Noelle,"Noelle... She puts enormous effort into trying to become a Knight of Favonius. However, I fear she is not quite ready for the dangers that lie beyond Mondstadt's walls."
288,Jean,Rosaria,"Some may see Sister Rosaria as one who complains about how bothersome her work is, but she does her job well. Last time I saw her I told her she could come find me should she ever need help, to which she simply replied that doing so would be even more bothersome. I need to work harder to become of more assistance to the people of Mondstadt."
289,Jean,Sucrose,"Sucrose is also a rare talent in the field of alchemy. Under Albedo's mentorship, she is sure to flourish. I am sure her future will be bright. The only thing is... Ahem, I was momentarily lost in thought. It is nothing. Nothing bad, anyway."
290,Jean,Varka,"Grand Master Varka is the legend of his generation. On the day of his triumphant return, I shall be sure to personally introduce you to him. I'm sure you too will be in awe of his greatness."
291,Kaedehara Kazuha,Beidou,I owe Beidou my life. She took me in when I fled from Inazuma and gave me the courage to return there at the most difficult time of my life. She is a comrade in whom I and all the other sailors can place our trust.
292,Kaedehara Kazuha,Gorou,"When I was a wanted man, the resistance gave me a lot of help. The time I spent with Gorou was brief, but he left a deep impression on me. He's the type of person who says whatever's on his mind. He shares the highs and lows of his subordinates, and is never afraid to draw his sword for the sake of a friend. That's the kind of person I can really get along with."
293,Kaedehara Kazuha,Kamisato Ayaka,"I'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the ""Shirasagi Himegimi."" The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?"
294,Kaedehara Kazuha,Kujou Sara,"She defeated my friend in a duel before the throne, which I accept as proof of her great strength. But she uses that strength to serve as an oppressor's lackey, leading the Kujou Clan's troops to relentlessly seek out and confiscate Visions. This... I cannot forgive.
I see... So she does have her own ideals that she is fighting for. But I have to wonder: can the Kujou family flourish as they did before once this storm has passed?"
295,Kaedehara Kazuha,Raiden Shogun,"I've asked myself this question many times since leaving Inazuma. Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams — not even a god."
296,Kaedehara Kazuha,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"During my time with the Resistance, there was no one among our ranks who wouldn't look up to Her Excellency. As someone with a great passion for military matters, victory at all costs isn't really part of her ethos. She'd always try to limit the casualties to the minimum while planning her next move. By some accounts, it also seems that she seeks to take charge of both internal and foreign affairs for Watatsumi Island. Wouldn't that be too much to expect of herself though?"
297,Kaedehara Kazuha,Shikanoin Heizou,"Don't be deceived by his happy-go-lucky disposition. As soon as he gets working on a case, that restless energy he carries around turns into a razor-sharp focus. It's quite remarkable to witness."
298,Kaedehara Kazuha,Yoimiya,"The last time she commissioned Captain Beidou to ship fireworks to Liyue, I unloaded the shipment myself. They were so heavy! I doubt that anyone besides her could make such huge fireworks."
299,Kaeya,Albedo,"Albedo, eh? Calm, collected, and incredibly talented. He's the type everybody likes, some even more so than others. What, you into him as well?"
300,Kaeya,Amber,That Outrider is a clever and righteous knight. Be careful not to step out of line in front of her.
301,Kaeya,Collei,"Oh, Collei? Oho, now there's a name I haven't heard in a while... You came to the right person! Let me tell you her whole story, starting right from the very beginning, with all the delicious details!"
302,Kaeya,Diluc,"Diluc? He was cute as a young lad. But nowadays he just seems to be in a world of his own... Overall, not much fun to hang out with."
303,Kaeya,Diona,"Have you tried one of Diona's drinks? Oh right, you're still underage. Haha, such a shame, it truly is — to not be able to revel with you in such bliss. Hehe, I guess all we can do is wait for you to be old enough."
304,Kaeya,Fischl,"Hmm? You think Fischl having one eye covered is very fitting given her title of Prinzessin der Verurteilung. Hahaha, if that's the case, that must also make me a descendant of some kind of former royal lineage, no?"
305,Kaeya,Jean,What? The Acting Grand Master? You need to give her your full support.
306,Kaeya,Klee,"Klee. Seems she has failed to elude the Acting Grand Master's investigative skills, despite the pointers I gave her... Haha, I'm kidding, no need to go reporting me or anything."
307,Kaeya,Lisa,Oh Lisa. Hmm... You'd better not forget to return your books on time. I made that mistake once and boy was she angry. My arm is still numb from last time...
308,Kaeya,Mika,"When I first met Mika, he seemed like the nervous type, so I decided to joke around with him a little. I didn't count on that making him even more nervous... His smile looked as if it were plastered onto his face, and in the end, he even wrote me a letter of apology. Tsk-tsk. Does taking everything so seriously run in the Schmidts' blood?"
309,Kaeya,Noelle,I was entrusted by the Acting Grand Master to work in the background to support Noelle. But there hasn't been much for me to concern myself with — she has a good head on her shoulders. Quite the relief.
310,Kaeya,Rosaria,"Ahaha, you want to know about the secrets of Sister Rosaria? That... I cannot tell you. Though my impression of her is not bad — certainly better than a certain someone whose name I won't bother to mention. She's honest with herself. She casts off that which she has no time for and she doesn't feign motivation for affairs that do not interest her."
311,Kaeya,Sucrose,"Sucrose may not be much of an extrovert in public, but as they say — it's always the quiet ones... Apparently, her laboratory is home to quite the eclectic range of implements and her experiments are more than just intellectually stimulating... All hearsay, of course. You don't seriously think I would go snooping around a fair lady's private quarters, do you?"
312,Kaeya,Varka,"Now that you mention him, it is a shame there is no one in the Knights of Favonius to inherit the Grand Master's approach to his work. *sigh* I must say I really do appreciate people like him."
313,Kamisato Ayaka,Kamisato Ayato,"As the head of the Kamisato Clan, brother always has a full schedule of places he needs to be. I do try my best to share his load, but there is no changing the pressure he is subjected to all year round, and the toll it takes upon him. *sigh* If you see him, remind him to take care of himself, for his sister's sake..."
314,Kamisato Ayaka,Kujou Sara,"Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission is... not known to smile, and I have had my fair share of disputes with her. She is, however, a loyal servant to Inazuma, there is no question about that."
315,Kamisato Ayaka,Raiden Shogun,"The Almighty Shogun? It would be improper of me to comment, given that I am one of her subjects. All I will say is that... I think that Her Excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.
To witness the Musou no Hitotachi and live to tell the tale is quite a remarkable feat. Even though I recognize her as our true deity with the power to change Inazuma's fate at will, if there is conflict between the two of you, then... I shall choose to side with you."
316,Kamisato Ayaka,Sayu,"Ah, little Sayu. She hasn't been causing you any trouble lately, has she? Hehe, if you ever notice her slacking off, please let me know."
317,Kamisato Ayaka,Shikanoin Heizou,"Mr. Shikanoin belongs to the Tenryou Commission, just like Miss Kujou. He is very... principled, sometimes even more determinedly so than Miss Kujou. The only thing is, when it comes to the question of which matters should be governed by his principles, I believe only Mr. Shikanoin himself knows the answer..."
318,Kamisato Ayaka,Thoma,"Thoma is a dear friend. He always lifts my spirits with his sunny disposition. In a sense, I think of him as another brother, and as a full member of the Kamisato Clan."
319,Kamisato Ayaka,Yae Miko,"I have always greatly enjoyed working with Guuji Yae. Organizing festival affairs generally takes a lot of effort and doesn't generate much income, but Guuji Yae's events always come off both elegant and profitable."
320,Kamisato Ayaka,Yoimiya,"The Yashiro Commission and the shrine maidens are responsible for festival affairs, and Yoimiya, as a fireworks expert, knows how to create an atmosphere. So we have become well acquainted with her over the years.Hmm? Public order and fire prevention? We factor these concerns in well in advance during the planning stage. To deny people the chance to see fireworks simply for these reasons would leave them feeling very disappointed."
321,Kamisato Ayato,Arataki Itto,"Now he's an interesting case. Pitting docile Onikabuto against each other in battle... heh, that's a first... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me ""bro""... To this day, he calls me ""my bro Ayato"" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... unique character."
322,Kamisato Ayato,Kaedehara Kazuha,"Once upon a time, the Kaedehara Clan was a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan. My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities..."
323,Kamisato Ayato,Kamisato Ayaka,"I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended."
324,Kamisato Ayato,Kujou Sara,"Old man Kujou capitalized on a golden opportunity to create a most formidable weapon indeed. The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation."
325,Kamisato Ayato,Ningguang,"I have heard a thing or two about how Her Eminence, the Tianquan operates. On the subject, I also happen to have a limited-edition copy of Liyue Millennial, if you're interested? What do you say, shall I have someone fetch it, so we can play a game?"
326,Kamisato Ayato,Raiden Shogun,"The cost of pursuing eternity has been great for the Almighty Shogun... and for all of Inazuma. These wounds will take time to heal, and as someone with a mediating role to play in the political process, I will be sure to fulfill that which is required of me."
327,Kamisato Ayato,Sayu,"She looks awfully idle the majority of the time, and yet when it counts, she always rises to the occasion and provides indispensable assistance. Of course, you'd know far more about that than me, wouldn't you?"
328,Kamisato Ayato,Thoma,"There is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them."
329,Kamisato Ayato,Yae Miko,"Lady Guuji has been kind to us in the Kamisato Clan, but she has never quite taken to me personally. I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... ""the Yashiro rascal"" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs — working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas."
330,Kamisato Ayato,Yoimiya,"Ah, the fireworks store owner. Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her. She is around the same age as Ayaka, and the two get along very well. I trust her direct and outspoken disposition won't lead Ayaka astray. Ayaka has always been staunchly true to herself, ever since she was a young child."
331,Kaveh,Alhaitham,"I guarantee you'll never meet anyone else who's as infuriating as him! And for the record, yes, I would say that to his face. Sure, he's smart, and sure, geniuses often come with a bad temper, but that's only half the story with him... He knows perfectly well how to appear friendly and likable to others, he just doesn't want to.If he ever gives you the impression that he doesn't really have a temper, or that he's rigidly logical like a machine, then you just don't know him well enough yet. He definitely has a personality, it's just... too big a personality. Most people wouldn't get it.
Alhaitham helped me out a fair amount recently. If we were still as close as we were during our student days, then I'd be thanking him every chance I got. Now, though... I can't seem get a word of appreciation out of my mouth. Even if I could, I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction.I guess you could say our relationship is something of a mixed bag these days? Honestly, with everything that's happened, it almost feels like the universe has been playing pranks on us... It's hard to make sense of it all... too much to process for one lifetime. I will say that it's not every day that you get to know someone like him — I just wish he could rein in some of the worst excesses of his personality. Okay, yeah, that's never gonna happen."
332,Kaveh,Collei,"I've met Collei quite a few times now. As Tighnari's student and assistant, she follows him everywhere. With her diligence and patience, she's much more responsible than most other kids her age. But, umm... I can also tell that she's got a lot going on inside."
333,Kaveh,Cyno,"Cyno can come across as cold and ruthless, but he's actually a very big-hearted guy. I still remember how shocked I was when Tighnari said he was gonna introduce me to his best friend, and then a couple of seconds later, an incredibly intimidating matra comes walking through the door... I honestly never expected to meet a matra who's so comfortable hanging out with scholars. Gotta say though, I can't stand his sense of humor. It really makes my skin crawl. If he ever invites you to a meal at Tighnari's place, make sure someone's bringing beer, because no one should have to endure Cyno's humor while sober."
334,Kaveh,Dori,"Dori is the owner of the Palace of Alcazarzaray... Excuse me? Mine? No, don't be ridiculous. I know full well that it doesn't belong to me... I know, I know, but... argh, please, let's not go there!Dori is a shrewd one. She knows how to coerce others into doing things for her. I, uh... For, ahem, various reasons, I now owe her a large sum of money. It all got quite complicated in the end, but... A—Anyway, I wish she'd show me a little mercy, and stop making my life a misery for the sake of Mora. I swear, she doesn't seem like a bad person at heart, so... I just don't understand, how did she turn out like this?"
335,Kaveh,Faruzan,"Madam Faruzan doesn't mince her words, so I can understand why some students at the Akademiya are afraid of her. She doesn't have any bad intentions, though — all she wants is to devote herself completely to the research that interests her. Some people say that all Haravatat scholars are hard to get along with, and uh... heh, I'll let you be the judge of that.I assume she's already asked you to be her student? She sure is a little intense when she's doing the hard sell, huh... But she can walk the walk too. She really does know her stuff."
336,Kaveh,Nahida,"Lesser Lord Kusanali is a wise and capable god. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable, she also possesses virtue far beyond mortal comprehension. I have only the utmost respect for her tolerance of others — especially in a nation of learning like Sumeru, that takes great equanimity.Sometimes, though, I do stop to wonder... Surely even the gods must have their struggles, too? Oftentimes, confusion is the beginning of wisdom... In which case, how can we ever achieve true happiness?"
337,Kaveh,Nilou,"Nilou's talent as a dancer is indisputable. Zubayr Theater really lucked out when they recruited her. I've heard that she has a great personality too — she always smiles and says encouraging things to her audience when she's performing. Once I can find some time, I'll have to catch one of her shows."
338,Kaveh,Tighnari,"Ah, Tighnari... He's one of the nicest guys you could know. If you've met him, you'll know what I mean. He's kind, and he has enormous expertise in his field, but he never brags about it in front of other people. And he seems to genuinely care about his work.Back when I was building the Palace of Alcazarzaray, I asked him for some tips on how to pick out the right ornamental plants. After he wrote back to me, he also helped me out with some other issues, too. Oh, and I almost forgot — he was the one who first introduced me to Cyno."
339,Keqing,Baizhu,"Everyone has faith in Dr. Baizhu's medical skills. He's the right guy to go to when you can't figure out what's wrong with you. Oh... the rumors, you say? The only one I know for a fact is true is how disgusting his medicine tastes. It's not just the kids who find it bitter, it's left me with some horrible memories, too!"
340,Keqing,Beidou,"That captain is always flouting the rules, and her personality really rubs people the wrong way. That said, The Crux Fleet is indispensable to Liyue Harbor. It's a bit of an art, knowing when to enforce the rules and when it's in everyone's interests to be more lenient. Thing is, the Tianquan is supposed to be the one enforcing the rules, but she always seems to be too busy..."
341,Keqing,Ganyu,"Who knows what Rex Lapis must have done to inspire such blind devotion from Ganyu... But her reluctance to be critical is not without its advantages. In the workplace, she'll carry out my instructions to the letter, even when I can tell she has her reservations. It's a good attitude to have as a career professional.
I find myself getting a second opinion from her a lot these days. Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh... I feel a bit awkward, though, because I used to be openly disparaging of Rex Lapis in front of her... But she doesn't seem to mind, so I guess I've got nothing to worry about..."
342,Keqing,Ningguang,"We do work together, but we couldn't be more opposite personality-wise. To her, Liyue Harbor is nothing more than a marketplace, and she'll do anything as long as it makes money for her. Doesn't she have any principles? Hmm, or maybe turning a profit IS her principle?
Since Rex Lapis left us, we've actually found some common ground. I was quite judgmental of her in the past, and we still fundamentally disagree on a number of issues, but in the current climate I have to say I count her as a comrade in arms.
Ugh, having said that... I ordered a Lucent Crescent from Mingxing Jewelry three months in advance, and when it was finally time to pick it up, they told me Ningguang had bought up the last few months' worth of Lucent Crescents for herself by paying double the price! *sigh* She can be such a pain!"
343,Keqing,Venti,"Since Rex Lapis left us, the question of Liyue's future has been on my mind constantly. In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too. Mondstadt's god is the one who baffles me the most though — how exactly do any of his actions contribute to the longevity of Mondstadt? It's completely beyond me."
344,Keqing,Xiangling,"Yeah, the up-and-coming chef from Wanmin Restaurant... I get that she's gifted and everything, I just think her cooking can be a bit hit-or-miss. I was all ready to hire her for a small banquet once, and give her full control over the menu... but the amount of lizard and slime in her sample dishes quickly turned me off that idea!"
345,Keqing,Xiao,"I feel like now that we live in the age of mankind's rule, it's time for the legendary boy-adeptus to be released from duty. We no longer need a defender of that kind, because we are capable of working through the challenges we face on our own strength."
346,Keqing,Xingqiu,"I've heard his story — he was born into a well-to-do family, but wasn't keen on the family business, so he now devotes his time to being an envoy of justice. I have huge respect for that! Not everyone has the guts to follow their dreams when it means breaking with a long-standing family tradition."
347,Keqing,Xinyan,"You know what, I think her music rocks. Too noisy by traditional standards, for sure, but I don't care. Good music is good music. And good music should reach the widest possible audience."
348,Keqing,Yanfei,"The way I see it, the law is a summary of things done the right way in the past. However, it should also be continuously adapted and improved to match the needs of the present. Given that Liyue is about to undergo a radical transformation, legal talent is in great demand. With an assistant like Yanfei, I could spare myself a great deal of trouble."
349,Keqing,Yelan,"Ms. Yelan's ancestors used to serve the Qixing. My grandfather and her family have had academic collaborations in the past. All in all, she's reliable, efficient, and provides important intel to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I can't say for sure how Ms. Yelan actually gets her intel, however..."
350,Keqing,Yun Jin,"When you're passing by Heyu Tea House and have to squeeze your way through the biggest crowd you've seen in your life, that's when you know Yun Jin's on stage performing. There's not a merchant in Liyue who wouldn't buy up the place if they had the chance, and Yun Jin is the reason it would be worth every Mora."
351,Keqing,Zhongli,"The gentleman from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? Clearly, he's an extremely learned individual, and I do have a lot of respect for him. But his mindset is too traditional for me — he thinks in the same tired old terms as Rex Lapis did... If he were more of an original thinker, I'm sure he'd be a great asset to me in reaching my objectives."
352,Kirara,Arataki Itto,"He's an oni, but he gets along with humans perfectly — he even has his own gang! Oh, I'm so jealous. Maybe I should go ask him for some advice."
353,Kirara,Chiori,"She's really nice to me. I often ran into her in the past when she was out researching ways to make fabrics and develop color palettes. She was always worried that I'd leave claw marks all over her beautiful textiles, but come on, why would I do that to her? She's running a store in Fontaine now and sometimes asks me to deliver stuff to her. Hehe, she even helped me tailor the clothes I'm wearing now."
354,Kirara,Kujou Sara,"I've always wanted to have a chat with the Lady Tengu. Maybe it's because she's the general of the Tenryou Commission, but I find her quite intimidating, so I've only ever watched her from afar. I—I'm just curious about her wings, you know? Are they ever an inconvenience? How does she deal with shedding feathers? Mm... Speaking of the feathers, I think lining my box with them would be super comfy."
355,Kirara,Lyney,"So I met this magician in Fontaine who could make anything disappear, then make it reappear out of thin air! He must've used some kind of youkai power to make that happen, right? Hmm... Is he a youkai too, then?"
356,Kirara,Raiden Shogun,Parcels sent to Tenshukaku are all packaged intricately with multiple layers of wrapping. Maybe that's what they call a package fit for the Almighty Shogun. Some of them smell really good... I wonder what's inside.
357,Kirara,Shikanoin Heizou,"I crossed paths with that detective a long while back. Once he learned that I was a nekomata, he started asking me to investigate the whereabouts of missing cats. I was happy to help at first, but then I'd hear the cats say things like ""I just want to see the outside world!"" or ""I get so bored when I'm at home,"" I felt bad for them. So I lied, telling him that I hadn't seen any cat at all. But it seemed like he could see right through me..."
358,Kirara,Yae Miko,"Lady Miko is a widely renowned kitsune youkai in Inazuma, so it's natural for young youkai like myself to approach her with reverence. But contrary to my expectations, she was surprisingly amiable. She even came to visit me in person and taught me lots of useful stuff about how to survive in human society! Things like proper human etiquette, ways to approach people, and different fried tofu recipes... Huh? That last one was just for her?"
359,Klee,Albedo,"Me and Albedo have a secret code! Whenever he puts a sign on his workshop door saying ""Experiment in Progress,"" that's code for ""Come back later, Klee."" Albedo's really nice and he's so patient with me, so I don't mind waiting until he's finished with his work."
360,Klee,Amber,Amber is the best! Baron Bunny is so fluffy and he even explodes! So. Cool.
361,Klee,Bennett,"Bennett is the best! I always find way more treasure if I go adventuring with Bennett! ...But he never finds any. Why is that, anyway?"
362,Klee,Diluc,He's one of the weird grown-ups. He's so grumpy all the time... Why does he never smile?
363,Klee,Diona,"Diona is the best! I like listening to her, last time I heard her say, ""I'm gonna destroy the wine industry in this city if it's the last thing I do!"" And I'm gonna help her using my bombs! ...I don't know what a wine industry is though. Is it a monster?"
364,Klee,Jean,Master Jean is the best! But she's also a little bit scary.
365,Klee,Kaeya,Kaeya is the best! He wrote the Favonius Survival Rulebook for me and he always helps me cover it up when I make a big disaster.
366,Klee,Lisa,"Lisa is the best! She always sneaks me some treats when I visit her at the workshop. ...Huh, I just remembered I was gonna ask her if I could use the workshop to make some new gunpowder. But I totally forgot..."
367,Klee,Mona,"Mona is the best! It's so much fun when she comes to play with me and Albedo. She talks about all these amazing things, and I don't understand most of it but... Ah, I just love it when Mona comes round!"
368,Klee,Razor,"Razor's one of my best buddies! Whenever a disaster happens, he always knows the best way to fix it and helps keep Klee safe. Um, but most of the time I'm the one who caused the disaster..."
369,Klee,Sucrose,"Sucrose is the best! This one time she asked me if I wanted a Jumpy Dumpty that can run as well as jump. Tee-hee, well duh! Of course I do, I want hundreds of them! I wanna put them on every street, every staircase, and every square in Mondstadt!"
370,Kujou Sara,Arataki Itto,"Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself."
371,Kujou Sara,Gorou,"Gorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better."
372,Kujou Sara,Kamisato Ayaka,"In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there."
373,Kujou Sara,Kirara,"Recently, I often feel a mysterious gaze from the shadows that disappears as soon as I turn to look. What an absurd prank... Huh? A nekomata, you say? Huh... She should've just come right up to me if she needed something."
374,Kujou Sara,Kuki Shinobu,"With her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission."
375,Kujou Sara,Raiden Shogun,"As I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity — an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. ""Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity""... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.
So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done."
376,Kujou Sara,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not."
377,Kujou Sara,Shikanoin Heizou,"Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results...*sigh* He is such a headache."
378,Kujou Sara,Thoma,"The Tenryou Commission's estate is very large. It would serve us well to have a fine housekeeper like Thoma who could keep all the numerous and disparate household affairs in order. If he ever tires of working for the Kamisato Clan, I would very much like for him to come to us... though I doubt that day will ever come."
379,Kujou Sara,Yae Miko,"Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance."
380,Kujou Sara,Yoimiya,"As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma."
381,Kuki Shinobu,Arataki Itto,"The boss has a lot of unpleasant memories from his past, but he still manages to stay positive. I'd say that kind of resilience is pretty rare. He treats us well and his character has a good effect on everyone in the gang. Of course, it's never an excuse for him to run amok with no consideration for others. Just let me know if he ever causes you any trouble and I'll be sure to make him regret ever being rude to you."
382,Kuki Shinobu,Kujou Sara,"Madam Kujou? Yes, she's a friend of mine. Hmm? You're surprised that I know her? Oh, you must've misunderstood, I knew her from before I joined the Arataki Gang. Heh, in fact, it's hard to tell who's the winner whenever we spar."
383,Kuki Shinobu,Raiden Shogun,"After the Sakoku Decree was lifted, the Raiden Shogun issued many decrees aimed at supporting the development of various industries. All those certificates I received during the Sakoku Decree are coming in real handy now, and the gang is finally out of the red... Fate really does have its ways. Who would've thought after all that, I'd still have her to thank?"
384,Kuki Shinobu,Shikanoin Heizou,"He's different from the other Doushin of the Tenryou Commission. I have yet to see him on patrol or apprehend anyone, and he occasionally comes to me to buy intelligence. In exchange, I asked him to put in a good word for me whenever I'm bailing people out of the Police Station. He gladly agreed. I'd say that's a pretty good deal... After all, getting the boys to keep their eyes and ears open on the streets is easy enough."
385,Kuki Shinobu,Yae Miko,You can't imagine how boring it is to be a shrine maiden. Even Lady Guuji from the Grand Narukami Shrine has her publishing gig to break up the monotony. I will never go back to being a shrine maiden. Never.
386,Kuki Shinobu,Yanfei,"Back then I had an argument with my family and I only wanted to run away as far as I could. So, I went to study law in Liyue, but thanks to this experience, I got to meet Yanfei. She's like a walking law encyclopedia. Huh? Me? I have a certificate but there are a lot of restrictions for practicing law... It's not really the right field for me."
387,Layla,Alhaitham,"I bet someone who's good enough to get a job like Scribe never has to worry about whether their projects will get approved or be successful. Wait... Oh shoot, if he's a Scribe, he probably doesn't have to do any projects in the first place. So lucky..."
388,Layla,Candace,"...Huh, I saw someone who matches that description when I woke up after sleepwalking for the first time. ""Candace,"" huh? Now I know. I still remember the moment I woke up... All of my reports and essays were done. At the time, it felt like... like after pleading to the stars for days and days, now they'd finally heard me, and sent a messenger to help me... I felt so touched!"
389,Layla,Cyno,"The General Mahamatra is really good at Genius Invokation TCG? Ooh, I wonder if... I mean, if I ever got the chance, maybe I could play a game with him. Card games like Genius Invokation TCG are always easier when you're good at mental math, so actually, I... I dunno, but... I might not necessarily lose to him."
390,Layla,Dori,"Oh... D—Dori... ahem... I took the plunge and bought something from her once. She looked euphoric as I was settling the bill — I think she assumed I was some sort of mega-rich person. Kept relentlessly sending product ads to me in the mail afterwards. Ugh... biggest mistake of my life! I paid such a huge price for it... 'cause not only did I spend all of my scholarship money in one go, but for most of the next year, I had to survive mainly on cheap vegetables, and I couldn't buy textbooks unless they were on sale..."
391,Layla,Faruzan,"Has Professor Faruzan managed to get any students? People from the Haravatat Darshan say that she always has difficulty getting funding for her projects, so it's hard for her to attract students, too. *sigh*..."
392,Layla,Lisa,"Oh, I know who you're talking about. Lisa Minci — the legendary Spantamad prodigy who graduated in just two years. If only I had her brains... Huh? You met her in person when you were in Mondstadt? R—Really? So... what's her studying process like? What books does she read, and what kind of work does she do? Where... Where should I start if I want to learn from her?"
393,Layla,Mona,"Mona Megistus, the Astrologist... Her astrology column in The Steambird is well-known among Rtawahist scholars. Her articles always cover super specialized topics, but can still be appreciated by non-academics. That's no easy feat... Huh? Her name seems to just roll off my tongue? Uh, that's just because... I have a lot of respect for... amazing people."
394,Layla,Nahida,"Dear Mighty God of Wisdom, I've been studying late into the night for days on end, please let me pass this exam! Please, please... Zzz..."
395,Lisa,Albedo,"Albedo is quite the alchemist. Just say the word and he'll come up with a good solution. He's easy on the eyes too, just like you."
396,Lisa,Amber,"Amber was just a young girl when she joined the knights, and in the blink of an eye, she's turned into such a strong young lady. I'm curious to see what she'll be like a few years from now."
397,Lisa,Barbara,"Have you heard Barbara sing before? Her angelic voice contains a magical healing energy. A different kind of magical energy from the one in my potions, of course. I wonder which one you prefer?"
398,Lisa,Collei,"Ah, dear little Collei. Every time she writes to me, she tries out new words and expressions she's learned recently... Hehe, no wonder she's improving so quickly. That wonderful and warmhearted master of hers must have helped a lot too."
399,Lisa,Cyno,"I've barely kept in touch with anyone from the Akademiya since leaving Sumeru, except for the occasional letters to my teachers out of basic courtesy. Fortunately, not every promising student turned out as lazy as I am... I heard that one of my juniors, Cyno, now leads quite the action-packed life."
400,Lisa,Diluc,"You want to know about Diluc? Haha, in that case, I know someone else you should talk to."
401,Lisa,Fischl,"Fischl, yes, she's always in the library looking to borrow fantasy novels. She always returns her books three days early and looks after them very well. She's a good kid."
402,Lisa,Jean,Jean is a gifted and dedicated leader. Seeing how hard she works makes even me want to help her out.
403,Lisa,Klee,"Last time little Klee wanted to use my workshop for her experiments, I had to say no, and she was angry at me for the rest of the day. *sigh* What happened the next day, you ask? She went off happily to play outside of course."
404,Lisa,Mika,"I do rather envy Huffman for having such a caring little brother. Mika takes care of everything around the house and even looks after him when he's drunk... Ah, how nice it must be to lounge around all day without a care in the world... Hmm? What do you mean, I already do that? You're getting quite bold these days, aren't you, cutie?"
405,Lisa,Mona,"As for Mona? She seems to be an excellent mage, but I'm not a part of their Hexenzirkel. The idea of Irminsul exploration and formal tea parties just leaves me cold."
406,Lisa,Noelle,"Every time I ask Noelle to dust off the bookshelves, I'm always left with the sense that the more exhausted I make her, the happier she becomes. Yes, who knows what's going on with her... *chuckles*"
407,Lisa,Razor,"Come on Razor, that's it, good boy! Let's do some combat practice — I've found you the perfect partner. Hey! Come back!"
408,Lisa,Sucrose,"Try not to bother Sucrose if you're at a loose end, you'll only startle the poor girl. She's gifted at interacting with all sorts of exotic creatures — just hopeless when it comes to humans."
409,Lynette,Arlecchino,"Oh, how ""Father"" expresses love... well, not everyone can accept it. But it is only because of ""Father"" that home... can be called home."
410,Lynette,Charlotte,"Uh... I was eventually cornered by her for interviews a few times. The way she persistently asked even after Lyney rejected her all those times, I really have to commend her perseverance. Too bad for her, though... despite preparing all those questions, I never answered a single one."
411,Lynette,Chiori,"The costumes Lyney and I wear for performances were specially tailored by Chiori. Once, Lyney was using a small knife for a magic trick, and accidentally cut the cuff of his sleeve a bit. She scolded us nonstop... it was scary. Luckily, I can hide behind Lyney whenever we go to her shop."
412,Lynette,Clorinde,"I was once ordered to observe a duel of hers. Even just as a bystander, the coldness radiating from her was absolutely chilling... I don't know what it would be like to face her directly in a duel, and I hope I will never find out."
413,Lynette,Emilie,"Her perfume products are so popular that you have to get in line before the break of dawn to have a chance at snapping any up. However, I'm far too sensitive to the smell of perfume, and it's really rude to sneeze... so I have to take the long way around."
414,Lynette,Freminet,"He is a delicate and gentle child, but also tends to belittle himself... perhaps due to his previous experiences. Sometimes he feels like the antithesis of Lyney... but since they're both family, when their opinions clash, I will bridge their differences."
415,Lynette,Furina,"Lady Furina's behavior is incredibly hard to explain, and I can't discern any useful intelligence from observing her. I always feel like her every move and action is an act, and she is playing different people... She truly is an Archon, one cannot apply the logic of ordinary humans to her."
416,Lynette,Lyney,"I have always been together with Lyney, and we can tell what the other is thinking without speaking. Thus, he tends to be more quiet than normal when we are alone. Hmm? Can I tell when he's lying or telling the truth? Of course I can, but this matter is top secret.
Lyney is normally quite confident, and does everything with incredible ease... or at least, that's how he wants everyone else to see him. So when he runs into difficulties, he always wants to solve everything perfectly on his own... if this happens, please be sure to take good care of him."
417,Lynette,Navia,"Though she's the new president of Spina di Rosula, her style is more like the nosy big sister next door. If we really had a sister like her in the ""House of the Hearth,"" that would be really great... I know I probably shouldn't be wishing for anyone to be an orphan, but..."
418,Lynette,Neuvillette,"The Chief Justice always feels strangely aloof, though his words are always humble... or perhaps he just doesn't like dealing with humans? After all, when he speaks with Melusines, he's actually quite friendly."
419,Lyney,Arlecchino,"""Father"" gave us a family, raised us, and told each of us what we should work towards. In turn, what I can do is very simple... Remain loyal, and protect our home.
Ours is a kingdom consisting only of children, and ""Father"" is our king. No king rules forever, of course, and I know that one day I will be chosen as ""Father's"" successor... But that also terrifies me... Please don't mention this to anyone, especially my sister and Freminet."
420,Lyney,Charlotte,"Charlotte has been trying to get me to agree to an interview ever since we met... Ugh, it feels like she's already asked twenty times now. She has a good nose for finding news, and she's the persistent type, too. But to be honest, I have no desire to find myself in the spotlight of one of her breaking news stories, and so I've found all sorts of reasons to decline each time."
421,Lyney,Chiori,"Flattery won't get you anywhere with her. She'll only give those who can truly appreciate her art a second look. How does she see me, you ask? Come on now, that hurts! Not only am I a connoisseur of the arts, but honest about it too, as I am in all my dealings!"
422,Lyney,Clorinde,"Clorinde's quite famous as a Champion Duelist. But from what I've read in the papers, she seems to have gotten into a bit of a pickle. The media's been all over her story, and she's... Well, she's the type that definitely doesn't enjoy that kind of attention."
423,Lyney,Emilie,"Have you ever gotten a whiff of the perfumes she makes? I quite liked them and was thinking to buy myself a bottle... But Lynette's tail indicated that she didn't share my opinion, so that was the end of that!"
424,Lyney,Freminet,"My naive little brother still believes in fairy tales. I envy him, really. Uh, just to be clear though, he didn't actually tell me that. I just happened to see what he keeps in his secret drawer once... Really, it was an accident! So please don't tell him, or he'll get mad at me for sure."
425,Lyney,Furina,"The Hydro Archon, Lady Furina, is very unpredictable, and her manner of speech can be quite provocative, almost as if she sees talking itself like some sort of performance. The people of Fontaine have a particular soft spot for excitement and drama, which is why many hold her in high esteem."
426,Lyney,Lynette,"You think my sister doesn't talk much? Oh, she's probably just not in the right mode. Next time, start by saying ""Activate Chat Mode"" to her. If you're lucky, she might have a great deal of things to say to you. Hmm, and if you're not lucky...? Well, she'll just stare for a while, but hey, at least you'll get to see a different side of her!
My sister and I have always been inseparable. There's no hardship we can't overcome as long as we're together, and similarly, we share all our joys with each other. There's nothing in the world I treasure more than my family, so I know what it must be like for you... And if I find out anything at all that might help you, I'll be sure to let you know."
427,Lyney,Navia,"I didn't think that she'd be willing to help strangers like us. If it hadn't been for all of you, Lynette and I wouldn't have been acquitted... Thank you so much. I'll have to wait for a lovely, sunny day to invite everyone to Café Lutece for the most wonderful afternoon tea!"
428,Lyney,Neuvillette,"Monsieur Neuvillette rarely appears in public, almost as if he's intentionally trying to put some distance between himself and the people. At first, I thought it might be just me, but my ever-observant sister noticed it too, so I suppose that must really be the case."
429,Mika,Albedo,"The Chief Alchemist has been very kind to me. He helped me make all the survey equipment I use in the field... I even have some pens he made that will work even when I'm hanging upside down from a tree. But it seems that making artistic sketches is quite different from making maps. I've tried to make some sketches of a target area as supplemental intel before, and word has it that Captain Albedo went silent for a long time when he saw them..."
430,Mika,Amber,"Oh? Amber the Outrider? She's the most reliable vanguard, and has amazing reconnaissance skills! The roles of Front-Line Surveyors and the Outriders are similar given that we both operate ahead of the main force. Amber has a lot of experience, and I've learned a lot of survival skills from her, as well as how to better maintain my crossbow strings and arrows."
431,Mika,Eula,"Captain Eula is a strong fighter with a combat style of her own, and she's always looked out for me. When I first joined the company, she assigned me a variety of tasks, way more than what other members had, and that quickly improved my ability to adapt. Once I grew accustomed to the way she expresses herself, I was able to work together with her just fine!
Actually, I really admire Captain Eula. She is friendly and free-spirited, and her mental fortitude is out of this world. If other people gave me strange looks all the time and talked behind my back like they do about her, I don't think I'd be able to leave my room..."
432,Mika,Jean,"The Deputy... I mean, the Acting Grand Master is a strong and considerate leader who always makes me feel at ease. She's always out there looking after all of us. Whether it's organizing work, rendering first aid, or cooking delicious meals, there's so much I can learn from her..."
433,Mika,Kaeya,"Before joining the Knights, I had to take a number of exams. Captain Kaeya was the main person in charge of all the testing. He was really supportive, and gave me all kinds of tips, but sometimes, I would struggle to understand what he was saying... I would get worried that I was not keeping up with his pace, and that I was letting him down..."
434,Mika,Klee,"Oh? Klee? She's super cheerful, and I've heard that... she's as strong as the Grand Master himself. She's invited me to go on adventures with her before, and we always had a great time together! Although she would experiment with dangerous weapons from time to time, which means I've had to revise my maps on several occasions... But I still feel it's worth it!"
435,Mika,Lisa,"Our librarian Lisa had always offered her help when I was first teaching myself how to draw maps. She even found a bunch of useful books for me to study. *sigh* If only I could be as well-learned as she is... After all, it never hurts to have more knowledge, and you never know when you might need it..."
436,Mika,Varka,"Grand Master Varka is not only a strong leader who commands respect, but also my personal combat instructor. He taught me to think on my feet and avoid engaging enemies at close combat to make up for my small stature and relative lack of stamina. Following his advice, I learned how to fight with a polearm and crossbow, and I must say, this fighting style is far more suitable to me.
The Grand Master said that I need to set higher goals for myself, and strive to achieve them. I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close..."
437,Mika,Venti,"I really like that bard... He's a very talented performer, and his melodies always seem to make me feel at home. If I had to pick a tune that best represents Mondstadt, it'd definitely be one of his. It's too bad that I'm not often in the city, otherwise, I could bring him some gifts every day..."
438,Mona,Albedo,"Albedo? Ah... I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs. What a wonderful life! If that batty old lady hadn't had one too many screws loose, perhaps that's the life I'd be living by now myself..."
439,Mona,Diluc,"Diluc Ragnvindr. His constellation, Noctua, represents vigilance in the darkness of night... A lone guardian keeping watch, longing for the splendor of dawn, yet destined to solitude in the dark days preceding its arrival....Or, wait, maybe Noctua's the one tied to wealth...?"
440,Mona,Jean,"You mean the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? Her constellation is Leo Minor, which represents strength and responsibility shouldered too young... Though the lioness has been separated from her pride for a long time, she grows from strength to strength, and the day will come when she is ready to return as its glorious leader."
441,Mona,Kaeya,"Kaeya Alberich? He's a Pavo Ocellus. Destined for greatness and grandeur... and to hide ugly realities behind a layer of charm and elegance. He believes he has made a clean break with his past, but one day fate will catch up with him. When it does, he will have a major decision to make."
442,Mona,Klee,"Ah yes, Alice's daughter. She's in the custody of the Knights of Favonius, and Albedo looks after her too. She's blessed to have Trifolium as her constellation, which represents good luck. I'm slightly envious... *smirk*Although, if I'd been blessed with good luck, I suppose I never would have had the great honor of running into that old woman, would I..."
443,Mona,Lisa,"A Tempus Fugit... The constellation derives its name from the hourglass, and stands for knowledge and time — or rather, the trade-off between them. As each grain of sand falls down, a moment of time — of life, even, dies for good. To stop the unrelenting flow of sand, one would have to turn the hourglass on its side. But once the sand comes to rest, it remains motionless forever... Hmm, maybe ""becomes lazy"" is more accurate than ""comes to rest,"" in this case."
444,Mona,Venti,"Venti? The bard that sits around doing nothing all day? What's so interesting about him? Sure, I guess I can take a look...Huh, that's weird, the scryglass, it's... I can't see a thing... this wind... I can't... open my eyes! No, my hat! Ah! My clothes, stop! The wind's going to strip all my clothes off! Make it stop, make it stop! ...Alright, alright! I'll never do this again!"
445,Nahida,Alhaitham,"He holds a body of knowledge more advanced than most could imagine, and his mind is constantly thinking, so maybe nothing in this world could ever fool him. But is the wise man truly wise to view the mediocre majority as defective? Because without them, there is no us."
446,Nahida,Collei,"When I heard her story for the first time, her tenacity shone through like a dazzling gemstone. She's been through so much... I hope that just as the rainforest supports all kinds of life, Sumeru will always provide a safe and nurturing environment for her, so that she can grow up healthy and strong."
447,Nahida,Cyno,"His jokes are like buried treasure: gems hidden beneath the surface. They're a lot of fun. Hmm? Well, which part didn't you get? Okay, I can explain it for you.
Not every General Mahamatra would take such a clear-cut and decisive stance when faced with a conflict between order and justice. He must know only too well that compromise is a path that leads to a dead end, so it's extremely fortunate for all of Sumeru that he's now been able to return to his rightful post."
448,Nahida,Dori,"The first thing she said when she saw me was ""Nice palace. How much?"" Of course, I couldn't possibly sell her the Sanctuary of Surasthana. But still, her question had me stumped. I thought about it long and hard, but I still can't figure out how much Mora it's worth..."
449,Nahida,Faruzan,"She is suffering from exposure to remnants of King Deshret's power. It's as if the great tortoise of time accidentally threw her off its back and left her suspended in the past. If you're interested, you should be able to catch a glimpse of Sumeru from a bygone age through her."
450,Nahida,Furina,"People often say that wisdom isn't about what you know, but knowing what you can change. It is beyond question that the ""prophecy"" was carved into Irminsul long ago... and while it may look like nothing has changed, it also seems like everything has. I think we both know her to be smart enough to turn the fate of the world around."
451,Nahida,Kaveh,"He has an almost-perfect grasp of what it truly means for Sumeru to be a Nation of Wisdom. Sadly, the truth as he understands it will never be accepted as the mainstream. Hmm? He's roommates with Alhaitham? Wow... the world really is full of surprises..."
452,Nahida,Nilou,"I once borrowed someone else's body to ask her if she'd mind allowing Lesser Lord Kusanali to watch her dance... Actually, I had already watched her lots of times before in secret, but I wanted to attend her dance at the Sabzeruz Festival properly, in person, as a sign of respect. Anyway, it turned out that she gently declined the offer... I was a little sad about that."
453,Nahida,Tighnari,"The Forest Watchers played an essential role in helping the rainforest to withstand the Withering and continue to flourish, and Tighnari is the best of them all. Still... I do hope he learns to be a little gentler with people. Otherwise, it's gonna be difficult for the Forest Rangers to attract new top talent."
454,Nahida,Wanderer,"When he finally achieved the ambition he thought he'd been pursuing all along, was he content at last, or only emptier still? We only yearn for the skies because we cannot fly... Hmm, perhaps he should reflect on this once he has held the sheer emptiness of the skies in his grasp."
455,Navia,Arlecchino,"She is a formidable but caring leader, and definitely comes across like a master of the house. But she's still a Fatui Harbinger, and that means she must have a more ruthless side. So don't worry — while I'll always appreciate what she did for Poisson, I'm not about to let my guard down around her completely."
456,Navia,Charlotte,"Charlotte's known for her fast-and-furious reporting, but it's her photography skills that really impress me. She once snapped a quick photo of me, a waist-up shot, and the result was absolutely stunning — it was like looking at an oil painting. She seems to have a knack for writing extraordinary news stories and taking the most eye-catching photos. Guess she was born to be a journalist."
457,Navia,Chiori,"Ah, the fashion designer who brought the coolest Inazuman trends to Fontaine? She's actually been a great help to the Spina behind the scenes. She says my unorthodox ideas always give her a lot of inspiration for her work, and from what I can tell, I think she means it. Still, she drew the line at my request for a ten-meter-tall top hat. *sigh* Missed opportunity, if you ask me... Imagine seeing one of those in front of the shop! It would be a great way to draw in customers."
458,Navia,Clorinde,"She might not say much, or show a lot of emotion, but I can tell that she feels deeply. After my father's death, I... well, it caused quite a rift between us for a long time. But even then, I never did like having her constantly walking on eggshells around me... I much prefer how things are now."
459,Navia,Furina,"I was lucky enough to catch her in an opera when I was young. Even though it was a charity show, the tickets were nearly impossible to get! She was performing in character then, but I thought she seemed more in her element then than she ever did as an Archon, giving speeches up in the opera box... Looking back, I guess my intuition was right."
460,Navia,Lynette; Lyney,"I know magicians can often be all bravado and razzmatazz, but I can tell that Lyney is a sincere guy who cares deeply about his friends and family. He's so mature for his age, it catches me off guard sometimes... Oh, and how could I forget — it was so kind of him to try and cheer up the children in Poisson with an impromptu free magic show during the flood! I'll have to invite him and Lynette over for some macarons at my place when I get the chance. I know Lynette's always conjuring teacups out of thin air, so surely at least she's a fan of a proper tea break?"
461,Navia,Neuvillette,"Ah, how to describe Monsieur Neuvillette... He's... complex, in some ways — but very straightforward in others. I guess a good analogy would be rocky reefs in the sea: Trying to navigate through obstacles you can't see makes for a bumpy ride, but if you can figure out how they work, you start to spot the signs."
462,Navia,Wriothesley,"Trying to discuss anything with that guy is an exhausting process. Clorinde says I needn't have any reservations about collaborating with him in the scope of our preexisting agreement, but I still shouldn't trust everything that comes out of his mouth. No wonder my father never tried to get involved with the affairs of the Fortress... I think I'll play it safe and keep things that way."
463,Neuvillette,Clorinde,"Clorinde's peerless skills have made her the most powerful Champion Duelist in our nation. As a successor to the Marechaussee Hunters of old, she plays a vital role in ensuring the fairness and impartiality of the courtroom. Also, she's actually not as stoic as she might appear."
464,Neuvillette,Furina,"Now, the curtain has finally fallen on her ""performance""... The character she portrayed was an imaginary one, yet in playing that role she fulfilled her duties... Though she is meek and full of doubt by nature, she was able to use madness to stiffen her resolve and see her duty through to its conclusion. The work that she has done over the centuries is truly immense. If she were to ever make a return to the stage, I should personally attend the performance and give her my heartfelt applause... Yes, I must do so when the opportunity arises."
465,Neuvillette,Lynette; Lyney,"Their performances are just fascinating, don't you think? They draw you into a magical world where, on one hand, everything that takes place is part of an elaborate deception — but on the other, all manner of miracles are possible if you are only willing to believe."
466,Neuvillette,Nahida,"Though the day will come when I put her on trial, I must commend the God of Verdure on her sense of responsibility. Few things are without flaws in this world, but the devotion and benevolence she displays are a testament to her commitment to continued progress. I felt enormous regret when I learned of the mistreatment she has endured over the past five hundred years."
467,Neuvillette,Navia,"I regret to say that after my various interactions with her — such as when I inadvertently angered her, and when I accepted her apology — and even now, in spite of the guilt I continue to feel over what happened to her father, I feel... very distant from her, as if I'm observing the starry sky from the bottom of a deep lake. It is by no means intentional, and I also know it is not something that I can easily make up for. Unlike water, emotion does not settle quickly once agitated, nor is it naturally inclined towards equilibrium."
468,Neuvillette,Raiden Shogun,"As a survivor of the dragon race who has regained my full dragonhood, I must fulfill my oath and obligations even if it means returning all the water in the oceans back to the heavens. In taking the Authority of Electro, the Narukami placed herself on the list of the usurpers. Oh, so she has isolated herself in the Plane of Euthymia, and now rarely appears in public? Then I shall pay her a visit in another few centuries."
469,Neuvillette,Sigewinne,"I don't know how Sigewinne is faring these days. But if I hear so much as the whiff of a rumor that she's being bullied, I shall summon Wriothesley here and demand an explanation. She's so kind and vulnerable... She brought me some Kamera film the last time she visited, and asked to listen to more of my commentary on the water of Natlan... How long is it until her next vacation?"
470,Neuvillette,Venti,"I shall fulfill my vow to judge all of The Seven in turn, even if the sky should fall and the ground give way. As the recipient of the Authority of Anemo, the God of Breeze and Hope must also stand trial. ...Hmm? He spends most of his time being a harmless drunkard, you say? Well, even so, I must meet him for myself and proceed from there."
471,Neuvillette,Wriothesley,"Wriothesley is a trustworthy man. I fought hard for the title and reputation he now has. I expect you to think that I've simply been duped by his flattery and appearance of loyalty... But to that, I would quote the Inazuman proverb: ""The words unspoken are the flower."" Which means, some things are best left unsaid."
472,Neuvillette,Zhongli,"Nothing will stop me from rendering judgment on each of The Seven. As the Archon who won the Authority of Geo, Deus Auri must be called to trial. If one does not wish to see us on opposite sides of a conflict, they need not worry, for I intend to stay in Fontaine for the foreseeable future, which could well mean another four hundred years. As another point of consolation, even when the trial eventually takes place, it is still not a given that the judgment will lead to a physical confrontation."
473,Nilou,Collei,"She sometimes comes to watch my performances. She's a really hard-working Trainee Forest Ranger. One time, she warned me about getting lost. What did she mean by that? It's not like I've gotten lost before..."
474,Nilou,Cyno,"I don't really like interacting with people from the Akademiya because they don't view the arts too kindly. I often wonder what they do when they're bored... Huh, Cyno plays Genius Invokation TCG? I can't believe it..."
475,Nilou,Dehya,"It's hard to believe that so many things have happened recently... I wanted to pick out a good present for Dehya and Dunyarzad, but I just can't make up my mind. Everyone at the Grand Bazaar has given me many suggestions, but if I took them all, it'd be too much... What should I do..."
476,Nilou,Dori,"The big-spending merchant Dori has watched me dance before. I remember that she talked with Mr. Zubayr once, and then never came back. Did something happen? ...Huh? She wanted me to go on tour around Teyvat? No way, Mr. Zubayr definitely would've refused for me! ...Ahh, please tell me he has..."
477,Nilou,Kaveh,"I heard he was the one who built the magnificent Palace of Alcazarzaray. He must have had a wonderful time making such a masterpiece, like when I'm in the middle of dance practice. Just thinking about dancing for everyone gives me so much happiness and motivation."
478,Nilou,Nahida,"The people of the Great Bazaar love Lesser Lord Kusanali. I'd love to hear her thoughts on my Dance of Sabzeruz... Oh, no, no, forget it... If she were in the audience, I'd get stage fright..."
479,Nilou,Tighnari,"I hear he's a really talented botanist. He must be good at telling apart mushrooms. At least, he would never have to worry about eating a poisonous one... I'm so jealous."
480,Ningguang,Amber,"Come forward, stand beside me. Do you see the Jade Chamber? At first it was just a room, and now it clouds Liyue. When the time comes that it hangs above all of the seven nations, you shall stand by my side on that day too."
481,Ningguang,Beidou,"That... captain. She clearly receives the adoration of many, but will always be the first to disregard the rules. The fines she has paid would be enough to buy her a whole new ship...
Perhaps you've never heard me speak like this. All that can be said has been said — both the good and the bad — but she still does as she pleases. Forget it. Keep Beidou out of my sight."
482,Ningguang,Ganyu,"One cannot afford to be overly reliant on others — even when it comes to Ganyu. There is a Liyue saying which goes, ""even the most meticulous can fall prey to happenstance."" When there are important affairs to deal with, it is always safer to investigate and resolve them personally."
483,Ningguang,Jean,"The Acting Grand Master of Mondstadt, a strict and impeccable woman. Her flawless etiquette knows no fault, even her letters are meticulously written and creased according to the prescribed rules. It is such easily overlooked details that offer a glimpse into the true qualities of one's character."
484,Ningguang,Keqing,"Yuheng... She has changed a lot recently. But is Liyue better off with the Yuheng we have now, or the Yuheng we used to know? Only time will tell."
485,Ningguang,Shenhe,"How is Miss Shenhe doing as of late? Please, look out for her whenever you can. I am most grateful to both of you for your assistance with rebuilding the Jade Chamber. Ahem, and on a more personal note — please know that if you are ever free, a cup of the finest tea will always be waiting for you here."
486,Ningguang,Xiangling,"That girl from Wanmin Restaurant... Her suspicion towards me is always written all over her face... Hehe, I wonder what face she would make if only she knew how much I helped finance that restaurant..."
487,Ningguang,Xianyun,"I plan to have Lady Xianyun over for a casual conversation over tea in a few days. I happen to have in my possession a number of mechanical devices, and I would be most interested to hear her insights on their design and use. It would also be a fine opportunity to hear about her experiences as an adeptus adapting to a new life in Liyue Harbor. All I require now is a suitable candidate to deliver the invitation to her on my behalf... Would you be interested, (Traveler)?"
488,Ningguang,Xingqiu,"The second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. People like him can't stand the sight of me, which is only to be expected. I have no intention of troubling him either. Those who have different beliefs should not work together."
489,Ningguang,Yanfei,"Yanfei? I suppose you could say she's a dear rival of mine... Were she not so deft at explaining the meanders of the law and providing her clients with all sorts of cunning suggestions, it would take me many more months to identify existing loopholes in the legal codices and tighten them one by one."
490,Ningguang,Yaoyao,"I presume you mean the girl whom Ganyu has taken under her wing. Do not worry, I have no plans to make this matter public. I am content to extend some leniency to the odd bit of mischievous maneuvering by that boat captain. One thing, though — Yaoyao seems to have become somewhat enamored with seafood lately. You should try to convince her to include some more fruits and vegetables in her diet."
491,Ningguang,Yelan,"She's a very interesting character. I can say with the utmost confidence that she is someone I trust unreservedly. She handles herself impeccably, which means she stays beyond reproach. Hehe, since you both have high intelligence in common, hopefully you will get along very well."
492,Ningguang,Yun Jin,"Yun Jin... Are you able to appreciate her performances? It might be difficult at first, but I would encourage you to give it a chance. The reason why I decided to invest into her opera troupe is quite simple: Elegant art forms like these deserve to be passed down to future generations."
493,Ningguang,Zhongli,Zhongli... Of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He's very versed in a great deal of affairs. Although... such excellent pawns are of no use to me until I know their weaknesses.
494,Noelle,Amber,"I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed. There's no risk of explosion whatsoever."
495,Noelle,Barbara,"We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara."
496,Noelle,Bennett,"He's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his ""dads"" like the other adventurers... the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer."
497,Noelle,Fischl,"I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.
So once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her."
498,Noelle,Jean,"Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!"
499,Noelle,Kaeya,"He's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, ""errand runner""? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!"
500,Noelle,Klee,"I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in a solitary confinement..."
501,Noelle,Varka,"At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!"
502,Qiqi,Baizhu,I can never remember Dr. Baizhu's face. But I don't mind.
503,Qiqi,Hu Tao,Warm. Fake smile. Death. I despise Hu Tao.
504,Qiqi,Xiao,"Sounds like a historical artifact to me.
Remind me, have I met him before?"
505,Qiqi,Xinyan,...Who?
506,Qiqi,Yaoyao,Cute. Like a nice little finch.
507,Raiden Shogun,Arataki Itto,Who?
508,Raiden Shogun,Kamisato Ayato,"Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Despite Ayato's trickery in regard to the Tri-Commission's affairs, he is nevertheless a loyal subject. His past misdeeds shall be excused."
509,Raiden Shogun,Kujou Sara,"A loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. She is worthy to be called a hero. With an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the Kujou Clan is assured."
510,Raiden Shogun,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"Indeed. It was I who slew Orobaxi. But I also allowed the people of Sangonomiya to continue worshiping it as the Watatsumi Omikami, so that it might enjoy their offerings. Now, Sangonomiya has destroyed the local Narukami Shrine and rebels against the Shogunate. As the Divine Priestess representing the Watatsumi Omikami, she must be held accountable."
511,Raiden Shogun,Yoimiya,"Who? Ah, the firework maker. A manufacturer of fleeting illusions, enamored with the realm of fantasy and imagination, but a subject of mine nonetheless.Hmm? Fireworks were released on Tenryou Commission property? By whom... her?"
512,Razor,Barbara,Shining Barbara is a good child. Very good child.
513,Razor,Bennett,"Bennett... Much talking. Eat with him, never full."
514,Razor,Diluc,Diluc is red and black. Hot and cold.
515,Razor,Klee,"Klee, friend! Friend, but... big hassle."
516,Razor,Lisa,Lisa lightning makes the sky black. She is strong. She is scary.
517,Razor,Varka,"Varka? Razor doesn't know...
Oh, Varka is... a name. That man big. Big steelclaw, Razor's name — Varka gave him. Oh... want to see him."
518,Razor,Venti,"Razor doesn't know poems, but... Lupical likes them."
519,Rosaria,Albedo,"He's like an oil painting you find hanging on the wall in some ancient hall, profound and mysterious... hard to see through. But what can I say, I find people with stories... interesting."
520,Rosaria,Barbara,"Barbara is like a thorn in my side, always nagging me about mass and choir practice. I wouldn't be surprised if Sister Victoria specifically asked her to keep an eye on me."
521,Rosaria,Diluc,"Isn't it obvious? There's more than meets the eye to that rich tycoon. He's confident, yet discreet... and even a little bit dangerous."
522,Rosaria,Jean,She's not only competent in her own work but also somehow manages to clear up various matters for others... Huh. Now that's a woman who deserves admiration.
523,Rosaria,Kaeya,"Wine has its uses... like revealing someone's true colors, for example. Smooth talk is Kaeya's veil, but being me, I can see right through it. Hah, you should see him when he's drunk."
524,Rosaria,Klee,"Trouble, and lots of it. Although, it is sort of a cute kind of trouble..."
525,Rosaria,Lisa,"Although I deplore those who play truant on a job, I respect her punctuality when it comes to closing up for the day."
526,Rosaria,Varka,"I'm sure Varka means well, but his long-winded conversations get real old real quick. Although, he does really care for those around him, doesn't he?"
527,Rosaria,Venti,There's something extremely interesting about this bard... I can't quite put my finger on it. There's something that makes him different from the others in Mondstadt.
528,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Beidou,"Ah... back when Beidou and I were carrying out ambushes against the Shogun's Army together, I raised my concerns that the enemy might detect our approach. But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship..."
529,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Gorou,"Gorou is an exceptional general... sincere, determined, and courageous. He has a strong camaraderie with the troops and is able to come up with creative battle plans. He does, however, have one shortcoming... He often lets the excitement of battle get to his head. If you are ever deployed to the battlefield together, be sure to have a good rein on him when things get underway."
530,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Kaedehara Kazuha,"Kazuha once came and bunked with the resistance for a time. If I'm not mistaken, he got along very well with Gorou — they would often fight side-by-side in battle. Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character."
531,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Kujou Sara,"Mmm... I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. She seldom employs cunning strategy, but her performance in open warfare is always admirable. The Shogun's Army places great trust in her abilities — they are united and ready to fight valiantly under her command, even to the death. Her forces have been a serious threat to the resistance on multiple occasions."
532,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Raiden Shogun,"Now that the Vision Hunt Decree is over, Watatsumi Island has once again returned to normal life. It has never been my intent to scrutinize the rights and wrongs of the Shogun's actions, even to this day. What I do care about is the future of our island. It is my hope that the Shogun will fulfill her promise and that we can live with the Shogunate in peace. However, if there comes a day when she once again casts aside the aspirations of the people, I can assure you that we won't sit by and watch."
533,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Shikanoin Heizou,"Initially, I was astonished to see anyone coming to Watatsumi Island wearing a Tenryou Commission uniform. A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed ""detective"" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself."
534,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Yae Miko,"I have also heard of Guuji Yae's great deeds. In all fairness, I hold her to be an outstanding shrine maiden, and she has performed her duties marvelously. I even heard that she holds responsibility where Yae Publishing House's light novels are concerned. An enigmatic individual to say the least..."
535,Sayu,Arataki Itto,Why does he have to make such a racket? And how did he get so tall!?
536,Sayu,Kamisato Ayaka,"As the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she always looks very graceful and elegant. But she got one of the shrine maidens to keep tabs on me and make sure I don't slack off... Why would she do that?"
537,Sayu,Kamisato Ayato,"Sometimes, when I'm taking a rest up in a tree, I overhear the shrine maidens talking about him. Sounds like he's pretty important and super busy most of the time. I don't get it, though — it's only work, or whatever, so why doesn't he just... not do it?"
538,Sayu,Kirara,"One time, when I woke up from an afternoon nap, I felt something warm against my back. I turned around and saw a cat curled up fast asleep. You wouldn't believe this — it had not only one, but two fluffy tails! I almost fell from the tree in surprise. I—Is this some form of ninjutsu too?"
539,Sayu,Kuki Shinobu,"Doesn't ring a bell, umm... What? Arataki Itto's little sidekick? Ugh, well she's definitely gotta be a sleep disturbance then. Birds of a feather flock together..."
540,Sayu,Raiden Shogun,"Her Excellency? Definitely not someone I'd ever get to meet. If you've got questions, maybe Miss Ayaka's the person to ask."
541,Sayu,Thoma,"He's got a Vision, and yet for some reason he pesters me about learning ninjutsu every time I run into him. I don't know what his deal is. It's not like I'd have the time to teach him anyway, I barely get enough sleep as it is."
542,Sayu,Yae Miko,"She's always patting me on the head... I've never bitten her, though, or even said anything, because I'm frightened of how she'd react if I stood up to her. But what am I gonna do? Because if she keeps on patting my head, I'm gonna get stuck at this height forever!"
543,Sayu,Yoimiya,"Every time she sees me she says, ""Hey, little tanuki! Let's go hang out at the festival."" Firstly, I'm not a tanuki. Secondly, I don't wanna go to a festival. Thirdly, she says she wants to hang out — but really, she just wants me to do a ninjutsu performance during the fireworks show. That's not even related to my work for the Shuumatsuban!"
544,Sethos,Alhaitham; Kaveh,"I saw those two at the tavern once. And another time at the cafe. ...Actually, I think I saw them once at the Grand Bazaar, too. The architect guy, he's always talking in a hushed tone — I guess he doesn't want people to hear, but uh... Okay, it's not like I purposely listen in, it's just... Something about those two guys hanging out together, you just can't look away."
545,Sethos,Candace,"Have you ever experienced Candace's hospitality? She cooks very generous portions — even I could barely finish. So long as you're on the receiving end of her hospitality and not her wrath, you'll live a long and happy life."
546,Sethos,Cyno,"Cyno is truly outstanding — absolutely a worthy heir to Henrmanubis's power. As General Mahamatra, he has the utmost reverence for knowledge and wisdom. If the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence do start working together again, I'll take comfort in the fact that he's there.Oh yeah, and another great thing about Cyno: You know the way he talks? It's just... so funny."
547,Sethos,Dehya,"Flame-Mane... everyone in the desert knows that name. The Eremites aren't exactly saints, as I'm sure you know, but Dehya's one of the few solid and dependable ones out there. If you ever want to explore the Great Red Sand, Dehya's the second-best guide you could ask for. First-best being me, obviously."
548,Sethos,Faruzan,"It's so rare to meet someone even more chummy than me! One minute I was taking a stroll near the Akademiya, the next minute she'd taken me on as a student, and was insisting on giving me a tour. She gave me a real fright, though, because she said that if I joined Haravatat, I'd get the 20-tongues language-learning package, mastery of all 100% guaranteed... I asked around, and it seems like that's just an in-joke among Akademiya students — there is no 20-language graduation requirement after all. But I don't get it... how is that funny? It's only gonna put people off studying there."
549,Sethos,Nilou,"I usually can't stay still for more than a few minutes, but Zubayr Theater is one place I don't mind just standing and watching while Nilou dances on the stage. It's a rare skill to be able to bring people such a sense of peace."
550,Sethos,Tighnari,"Tighnari's made of strong stuff. I only found out after the fact that he doesn't cope well with the desert climate — never would've guessed from how he performed in the Rite of Duels. I was also surprised when he sent me a letter inviting me to visit Gandharva Ville, saying it would be a good chance to meet some of Cyno's friends. Are those guys always such a hoot with their jokes? Dinner with them must be hilarious — I can't wait!"
551,Sethos,Wanderer,"Who is that guy, anyway? A foreign exchange student, or something? He has a pretty incredible hat, never seen anything like it. I tried to get a closer look once, but then I blinked and he was gone. Shame. I won't let him get away next time, though. I also hear he has some pretty interesting ideas... Gotta have a chat with him sometime!"
552,Shenhe,Baizhu,"The quality of his medicinal herbs is as good as it gets, he is also easy-going and considerate of others. By comparison, the little snake on his neck has no filter at all... Haha, don't worry, I didn't lift a finger against it, I won't go as far as getting into a quarrel with a snake."
553,Shenhe,Beidou,"I find I don't need to worry about etiquette with her, and unlike with some people, I don't need to rely on non-verbal cues to discern the true meaning of what she's saying. That makes me a lot more comfortable. The only problem is... Well, there are too many people around her all the time, and I heard there's also many crew members on her ship... I need you to go with me. It's the only way I can cope with so many people."
554,Shenhe,Chongyun,"It's hard for me to believe that... I still have living relatives in this world. If he has any difficulties with his training, I am more than willing to help enlighten him. However, he will need to meet me alone in the mountains. Their family is too... sociable. I wouldn't know how to turn down their invitations without being impolite."
555,Shenhe,Ganyu,"I've heard many stories about her from my master. She's really quite different from how I originally imagined her... But don't worry, I'll be keeping this to myself. Speaking of Ganyu, her work in Liyue Harbor is unbelievably busy... It seems that there is a price to pay for those who want to integrate into the mortal world."
556,Shenhe,Hu Tao,"I often see her wandering in the woods singing strange songs. Actually, I must have heard all of her songs several times each by now. I'm used to her singing, but I still find it strange. That being said, I don't hate it either."
557,Shenhe,Ningguang,"I have no use for the wealth that ordinary people desire. But in the hands of Lady Ningguang, wealth becomes a means of solving complex issues of the kind that no weapons could ever hope to resolve. She understands the unwritten rules of human society, she knows what's in people's hearts... Master once told me that even the adepti aren't able to achieve this. I hold her and her work in high regard."
558,Shenhe,Xianyun,"The last time Master and Shuyu came to dine at Wanmin Restaurant, I noticed that Shuyu seemed to have adopted a number of Master's mannerisms. It gave me pause for thought... I grew up under Master's care, too. Is it possible that I have subconsciously picked up a thing or two from her as well...?"
559,Shenhe,Xiao,"My first impression of him was that he's not one to smile. After meeting him again more recently, however, he's still as reserved as ever, but... he seems a lot more relaxed now. Maybe he... met someone special."
560,Shenhe,Xingqiu,"I've seen him lean over to you and whisper things in your ear. If he dares threaten you, I will make sure he... Hmm? You mean it's just an in-joke between friends? Genuinely...?"
561,Shenhe,Yun Jin,"Yun Jin performs... It's called ""Liyue opera,"" isn't it? I like this particular type of social interaction. You can get to know about the other person's background without having to actually interact with them one on one. If she ever includes your story in one of her performances, I'm sure the result will end up being quite incredible. I'm looking forward to it."
562,Shenhe,Zhongli,"That gentleman claims to be a mortal, yet is very familiar with my master, who is an adeptus. Master once said: ""If you see him drinking on a stone stool in front of my abode, do not disturb him. Let him sit quietly for a while."" And that's precisely what I did."
563,Shikanoin Heizou,Arataki Itto,"I've done a few favors before to deliver Roasted Lavender Melon to him in prison. This one time, I overheard him singing. The lyrics... were complete trash, but I gotta say — he has a pretty good set of pipes. And it's not every day you come across an inmate who's in the mood to sing their heart out."
564,Shikanoin Heizou,Gorou,"General Gorou's constant suspicion made my trip to Watatsumi Island much more eventful... Everywhere I went, there were soldiers keeping me under close surveillance. Honestly, I was a regular, boring tourist just like everybody else. So what if I happen to be a detective in my day job? I was clearly minding my own business there."
565,Shikanoin Heizou,Kaedehara Kazuha,"Oh, Kazuha? Yeah, he's a solid guy. With his help, I felt like a locked treasure chest of clues had been bust wide open and emptied all over the ground for me to see. If only I had his sensitivity to the natural world... Oh, I get it now! The wind to him must be like my intuition to me!
Ohh... It's such a pity! Since the Vision Hunt Decree's been repealed, I no longer have any grounds to officially arrest him. But then again... I guess now, I can just openly invite him to come to the Tenryou Commission and discuss cases with me."
566,Shikanoin Heizou,Kamisato Ayaka,I'm barely acquainted with the daughter of the Kamisato Clan. I'm glad that I'm not from some sort of prestigious family like that... it's definitely not the kind of life for me.
567,Shikanoin Heizou,Kujou Sara,"Madam Kujou Sara? Yeah, that lady's gotta be the most serious person in the entire Tenryou Commission. It would be nice if she could cut us a little slack and give everyone some breathing room — and she's always on my case about my occasional unexplained absences, but what can I say... I just go wherever the evidence leads me."
568,Shikanoin Heizou,Kuki Shinobu,"The Arataki Gang is a free and diverse organization that accepts anyone, regardless of their background. Pretty amazing if you ask me. They're lucky to have Shinobu to help keep them all in line. Hmm? How do I know all this? Haha, I mean... as deductions go, this one was pretty elementary."
569,Shikanoin Heizou,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"I've actually never seen Madam Sangonomiya before. Whenever she appears, practically the whole village crowds around her... I'm not about to contend with that. Oh, and even if you made it through all the villagers, there'd still be a circle of shrine maidens around her! For one of us young people to gain that kind of recognition from everyone, it must have taken a lot of work."
570,Shikanoin Heizou,Yae Miko,"Come to think of it, Lady Guuji's publishing house also publishes murder mysteries, right? So... when can you introduce me? In this day and age, becoming a famous detective requires more than just ability — you need publicity, too. Huh? C'mon, I'm being serious here!"
571,Sucrose,Albedo,"As his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art.
Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams — nothing more."
572,Sucrose,Amber,"I'm curious as to why her doll is called ""Baron Bunny,"" it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say? Hmm... That's heavily reliant on the rabbit stereotype, is it not? Many rabbits' ears are floppy."
573,Sucrose,Eula,"The role of a scout is a hazardous one, and Ms. Eula throws herself into danger all too easily. So, I made a reconnaissance device for her, so that she wouldn't have to infiltrate enemy camps herself. But Ms. Eula has such an imposing manner, she really puts me on edge, and... I was so nervous that I accidentally left out a few important details while explaining how to use it... As a result, there was an accident...Ah, what should I do... I hope she won't hold a grudge against me..."
574,Sucrose,Fischl,"I take it you're referring to the book series, Flowers for Princess Fischl? Indeed, the world the author came up with is very creative. If only I could go see it with my own eyes. Oh, you're referring to Fischl herself? I am... doubtful that she could really take me there."
575,Sucrose,Jean,"I don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all — I know that, I do — but... I still find her scary. I don't tend to bother her, and even when I have to... I ask Albedo to go on my behalf."
576,Sucrose,Kaeya,"Oh... I know he likes to joke, and isn't trying to make fun of me, but I often struggle to work out which parts of what he says are the truth and which parts are jokes. So whenever he talks to me, the outcome is usually one of two things: morbid embarrassment or unbearable awkwardness."
577,Sucrose,Klee,"Jean has put her into solitary confinement so many times, but every time she's let out it's not long before she's back in trouble. *sigh* Something tells me she hasn't done much introspection. I told her I'd make her a bouncing, dancing Jumpy Dumpty that is also safe — but to date there are still a lot of problems with the design."
578,Sucrose,Lisa,"She really seems to know a great deal. She's obviously never seen my research, and yet on so many occasions she's given me advice on that which is most core to my studies. Just how does she know? Is it observation, or is it ratiocination?"
579,Sucrose,Noelle,"She's... a very willing helper, I can't deny that. It's just... she makes me a little anxious is all. One time, she saw three boxes of materials stacked just outside my laboratory door, and proceeded to move them inside for me. A nice gesture, but the thing is... I'd only just finished putting them outside..."
580,Tartaglia,Arlecchino,"Look, I've got nothing against people who have their own agendas — I myself joined the Fatui to get more experience in combat. But I don't like her at all. If she stood to benefit from betraying others, she'd turn against the Tsaritsa in a heartbeat. There isn't a sane bone in her body."
581,Tartaglia,Columbina,"The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her."
582,Tartaglia,Il Capitano,"I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of."
583,Tartaglia,Il Dottore,"I heard that he took segments of himself at different ages, made prostheses out of them, and assigned different tasks to each one. I know... all my comrades are a little weird. Well, come to think of it, if I met another version of myself... Hah, we'd have to fight then and there to decide which one of us gets to survive."
584,Tartaglia,Pantalone,"Oh, now that guy has a head full of grandiose plans fueled by raw ambition. I don't understand a word he says once he starts talking about his theories... Eh, but as long as he keeps our cash reserves stocked up, I'm not complaining."
585,Tartaglia,Pierro,"He was the first ever Fatui Harbinger, and today he is our leader. He only appears on important occasions. As for his accomplishments... To be honest, I don't really care. I owe my loyalty and devotion to the Tsaritsa, no one else."
586,Tartaglia,Pulcinella,"I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family."
587,Tartaglia,Sandrone,"She always seems engrossed in her research. Hmm... I wonder if those machines have anything to do with her? Anyway, I've only met her a few times, but every time she looked like she wanted to murder me. I have no idea what I possibly could have done to annoy her, though."
588,Tartaglia,Skirk,"It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me..."
589,Tartaglia,Tsaritsa,"Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you."
590,Tartaglia,Varka,"Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world."
591,Tartaglia,Wanderer,"After he took the Gnosis, we lost all contact with him. Now comes the task of trying to hunt it down and get it back... I actually don't mind it — it means I get to travel all over. Wonder if I'll run into you somewhere along the way?"
592,Tartaglia,Zhongli,"There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think.
Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to ""mortal"" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha..."
593,Thoma,Arataki Itto,"Hmm... Word on the street is that he's quite a character — apparently, he even has youkai heritage. Have you met him? If you two are close, maybe you could introduce me sometime. It's good to make friends from all walks of life... youkai included!"
594,Thoma,Beidou,"The captain of The Crux — a formidable woman indeed. She once promised to take me out onto the open ocean to get a look at the thunderstorm that seals off Inazuma from the outside world. It's a shame that to this day, I've never had the chance to take her up on the offer..."
595,Thoma,Eula,"You've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories."
596,Thoma,Jean,"Oh, so Jean from the Gunnhildr Clan is the Master of the Knights of Favonius now? She definitely deserves it, she's known all over for her impeccable conduct... Oh, just the ""Acting"" Grand Master? Haha, well, someone of her standing won't care about titles."
597,Thoma,Kamisato Ayaka,"Milady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little."
598,Thoma,Kamisato Ayato,"As head of the Kamisato Clan, he's in a tough position. With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home."
599,Thoma,Kujou Sara,"The Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her."
600,Thoma,Raiden Shogun,"In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear.
Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach."
601,Thoma,Sayu,"Ah Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?"
602,Thoma,Shikanoin Heizou,"Ho, that guy is a detective for the Tenryou Commission. He seems to have his own way of doing things — not the easiest person to get along with. Also... Any situation that involves a detective is probably not one that's going to end well. I think I'll keep on giving him a wide berth."
603,Thoma,Yae Miko,"Lady Miko? Wh—What about her? *sigh* Every time Miss Kamisato sends me out to deliver messages, my least-favorite destination is the Grand Narukami Shrine... Oh! N—Not because Lady Miko scares the bejeebers out of me, it's, uh... respect. Yes! She strikes respect deep into my heart, ahahahaha..."
604,Thoma,Yoimiya,"Of Naganohara Fireworks fame? She's so easy to get along with. Super straightforward, just says whatever she thinks. Oh, and Naganohara fireworks are just incredible, you should take every chance you get to see them in action. Ah, on that note — here, have a coupon!"
605,Tighnari,Alhaitham,"Be careful of Alhaitham. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he purely operates by rationality, so people often find his actions unacceptable. If you don't believe me, just ask his roommate — thanks to Alhaitham, he has more pent-up frustration than an angry Anemo Slime."
606,Tighnari,Collei,"When that child was first brought here, she was effectively illiterate. It wasn't a huge issue, though. She's a hard worker and a diligent student, so she's made good progress. Still, her goal is to learn advanced medical techniques, so she still has a long way to go. She sometimes puts too much pressure on herself... Help her out when you can, would you? Consider it a favor for me as her mentor. Thanks a lot."
607,Tighnari,Cyno,"You want to see Cyno...? Well, firstly, a word of caution: if he ever comes chasing you down for work-related reasons, prepare for the nightmare of a lifetime. Other than that, General Mahamatra is a high-ranking position, so it usually isn't easy to find him. But he does occasionally go to Gandharva Ville to see Collei. As much as he might want to stay unnoticed, he can't fool my ears.
After my adviser's rescue, I wrote him a letter to send my regards. To my surprise, he wrote back saying that someone had already given him my regards in person. He ended the letter with a question ""The General Mahamatra said he hopes that the sages will enjoy 'a more tasteful reputation' thanks to the efforts of our Darshan. Whatever do you suppose he meant by 'a more tasteful reputation'?"" ...It's a good question. I'd like to know, too."
608,Tighnari,Dehya,"Everything happened so fast, and I didn't get the chance to properly thank her. To have a capable and reliable person like her on your side is extremely fortunate. I'm sure she must have many groups trying to persuade her to join their ranks. But she definitely doesn't strike me as the kind of person who would be interested in joining the Akademiya or the Forest Rangers, so I'll spare myself the inevitable rejection."
609,Tighnari,Dori,"The renowned Lord Sangemah Bay is none other than Dori. I became acquainted with her through a previous research project. It had required very rare materials, and the only way I could get them was through her and her mysterious supply network. Uh... never you mind what I was buying and what I was researching, thank you very much!"
610,Tighnari,Faruzan,Madam Faruzan possesses an extensive wealth of knowledge. I often invite her to inspect the mechanisms in the rainforest. The next time she's in Gandharva Ville... *sigh* I hope she doesn't sneak Collei more food. Nutrition is like medicine: moderation is key.
611,Tighnari,Kaveh,"Kaveh is a famous architect in Sumeru. The Palace of Alcazarzaray is his magnum opus. During the initial planning, he even asked me to recommend suitable ornamental flora. I don't know why or how, but he ended up heavily in debt after the palace was completed. Alhaitham is helping out by letting him stay at his place, but... I don't know whether that's a blessing or a curse..."
612,Tighnari,Layla,"I've heard of her, the famous ""Sleepwalking Eccentric."" The rumors about her sleepwalking are really quite absurd: feats of superhuman strength, sprinting through Aaru Village at night, scaling the Wall of Samiel with her bare hands... Some even say that she can write a 100,000-word thesis while asleep! What a load of nonsense."
613,Tighnari,Lisa,"Cyno has mentioned her before — an extraordinary genius with a veritable wealth of knowledge and talent. A pity that she returned to Mondstadt so long ago. Perhaps, in the course of her study, she witnessed the horrifying side of knowledge..."
614,Tighnari,Nahida,"As a student, I once heard this saying: ""Plants and the Land of Dendro share the same history."" It could just be one of those things that people say, but I've always felt that there's a deeper meaning to those words... If I meet Lesser Lord Kusanali one day, I wonder if she would explain them to me?"
615,Tighnari,Sethos,"Sethos? Pretty interesting guy. He's like a distant cousin of Cyno's. Really easy to get along with. Last time he visited us in Gandharva Ville, he insisted on showing off his tent-pitching skills and had a fishing competition with Cyno. Collei got really upset, because she thought there was nothing for her to do anymore...People say Sethos is good at keeping himself amused — he certainly seems pretty cheerful. But he takes his work very seriously. Hmm, although I don't know how accurate ""work"" is — I think he sees his role at the Temple of Silence as more of a kind of duty. Anyway, if you ever find yourself needing assistance in the desert, I'm sure he'd be a good person to go to."
616,Venti,Albedo,"How do you explain white chalk in black soil, or the earth's dense crust amidst the emptiness of space? Same reason the purest soil gave birth to human life... It's an ancient power with unmistakable properties. Trying to harness it is dangerous indeed, I can't imagine what would happen if someone lost control of it in the city... Ah, never mind! What goes on within Mondstadt's walls is up to Mondstadt's people to deal with!"
617,Venti,Barbara,"The darling Deaconess with the sweet singing voice — do you know her? You do? Idol, huh? Meet and greets? Concerts? Wow... That's the power of music for you..."
618,Venti,Diluc,"I'm not surprised you want to befriend Master Diluc, just think of all vintage wine he must have stored away... Mwuhahaha... Huh? He doesn't let you sample it? Not even the slightest drop? Huh... Well, I guess you can still appreciate the aroma. That's still better than no wine at all, right? No?"
619,Venti,Diona,"There's a special drink known far and wide at Cat's Tail. But it ah... ahh... ACHOO! *sniffs* How about you go and fetch one for me? I'll be truly thankful, I promise."
620,Venti,Eula,"Eula has good taste when it comes to beverages of the alcoholic variety. Come summer or winter, she always likes them ice-cold. That's rare among Mondstadters these days! She and I would make great drinking buddies. Huh? My songs about the Lawrence Clan... She's heard them already? Eh, no harm done. Maybe she and I can do a duet sometime!"
621,Venti,Furina,"A bard must be versed in both music and song, but a stage performer requires far more skills than just these... Hey, don't you think we should invite her over to put on a show at the next Windblume Festival? ...Huh? You want me to talk about how she saved Fontaine? Well, I mean, she's such a talented artiste, it's no wonder. I wouldn't be surprised even if she'd saved the entire world."
622,Venti,Jean,"Acting Grand Master Jean... Well, what do you think of her? Yes, I couldn't agree more: conscientious, courageous... kind and considerate too. Reminds me of another good friend..."
623,Venti,Mona,"Oh, that astrologer? How should I put it? Fortune telling and my singing are the same. Both lead to you being so poor you can't even cough up the money for a drink! ...You think that astrology is a cultural tradition, so at least still has some value? Hmph, so rude. In that case, so too is singing, so it still has its value too!"
624,Venti,Nahida,"The first thing you think of when you hear ""Dendro Archon"" is her power over dreams. Her dreams are akin to my ballads: full of emotion and imagination. It goes without saying that we get along really well."
625,Venti,Raiden Shogun,"So, I hear you defeated the mighty Raiden Shogun? Ah, I recall the days when she was a kagemusha, seeking to perfect her martial prowess. Hehe, she now no doubt employs a wide range of reasoning to get you to train with her. Oh but yes, come close and I shall let you in on her weakness — desserts!"
626,Venti,Razor,"Ah yes, the white-haired fellow from Wolvendom? Raised by wolves? Really? ... No wonder his scent is so familiar..."
627,Venti,Zhongli,"Have you seen that gentleman around? Huh? He's just a normal man by the name of Zhongli now? That must be quite the change for that old block-head. Come with me to see him, will you? I have a vintage I dug up from Windrise that I can take as a condolence gift. Oh, ahh... did he still seem strong when you saw him? How strong? Am I likely to get blown away?"
628,Wanderer,Arlecchino,"A wolf in sheep's clothing. To exert a higher level of control over people, she puts on a graceful and cordial front. Most of those who have seen her true, crazy self... have gone poof."
629,Wanderer,Columbina,"Let me ask: what should you do if you were to encounter a ""damsel"" who is oblivious and innocent at any given time, and unconcerned and unfeeling in any given situation? If it were me, I could at least challenge her to a fight. But if it were you... with your conscience, I would stay away from her."
630,Wanderer,Il Capitano,"""The ever-righteous Captain,"" ""the brave and fearless Captain,"" ""the nigh-invincible Captain""... Even my mechanical ears demand maintenance after listening to so many compliments from the members of the Fatui. Don't you think that possessing absolute righteousness is actually a latent danger? And that's without taking his great personal strength into account."
631,Wanderer,Il Dottore,It's a pity that Lesser Lord Kusanali already forced him to erase so many of his segments. The joy I would have derived from slicing them apart one by one...
632,Wanderer,Kaedehara Kazuha,"You speak of the descendant of the Kaedehara clan? Then isn't he... Wait, he also possesses an Anemo Vision? ...And even managed to take on the Raiden Shogun's Musou no Hitotachi? Hehe... Ahahahaha!"
633,Wanderer,Nahida,"While I still had value as a pawn, she might have had other reasons to keep me alive. It's certainly possible that it was because she's wise or benevolent, or happened to see a hint of loneliness within me... You think I'm trying to think the worst of her? Hah, did you really expect anything else? In case you've forgotten, I'm no saint."
634,Wanderer,Pantalone,"Oh, the ninth-ranked guy. He's obsessed with the idea of ""fair exchange,"" to the point of wanting to overthrow the natural imbalance between gods and humans. But, I guess it's just how ordinary mortals are like — it's easy for them to come up with pointless delusions. Honestly, it's nothing worth writing home about, just like how there's also nothing impressive about his abilities or choice of partner. Hmph. Anyone who chooses to work closely with The Doctor is sure to meet a nasty end."
635,Wanderer,Pierro,"The Jester is a survivor of Khaenri'ah. Besides that singular fact, I know very little about him, and never had any kind of close association with him. He seems to want something from me, though. In the past, he assigned to me many important tasks, including a number of trips to the Abyss."
636,Wanderer,Pulcinella,"Only someone as dense as Childe would think The Rooster is looking after him and his family out of the goodness of his heart. Although the mayor has indeed done a number of things for their benefit, anyone with a brain would be able to tell that the underlying meaning is ""your entire family is in my hands."""
637,Wanderer,Raiden Shogun,"She completely neglected her own creation, and to add insult to injury, she said it was because she ""couldn't bring herself to intervene"" in my fate..."
638,Wanderer,Sandrone,"She has a terrible personality and cares for nothing outside of her own research. But even with that amount of dedication, she still produced a copious amount of garbage, and could only secure a ranking that's still one whole place beneath my own. How pitiful."
639,Wanderer,Sethos,"What makes you think I know him? The fact that he's always following me around and asking for a closer look at my hat? We've barely spoken before. The first time we met, he came up and asked me if I was Hat Guy... Last time I checked, judging someone by their appearance is superficial. Hmph, somehow, everyone knows the name ""Hat Guy"" now..."
640,Wanderer,Tartaglia,"He's simple of mind and not that strong of body. Naming him to the lowest-ranked seat lowered the Harbingers' collective prestige. Thankfully, I'm no longer part of that group."
641,Wanderer,Tsaritsa,"Everyone praises her for her kindness and benevolence, but they forget that love is also a form of sin. What if she's just trying to compensate for something?"
642,Wanderer,Yae Miko,"A smooth-talking youkai. Though she pretends to care about humans to gain the favor of her god, all she seeks are entertaining ways to pass her time."
643,Wriothesley,Chevreuse,"Most inmates seem to gain a new level of respect for the rules after receiving attention from the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. As the captain, Chevreuse is an instrumental part of that team."
644,Wriothesley,Clorinde,"Clorinde is the best Champion Duelist you can find. Her combat prowess is already the stuff of legend. I've never fought her myself, but that's because there's never been a need for it."
645,Wriothesley,Emilie,"The Fortress of Meropide doesn't need her services. Yet some things are best preserved the way they are, warts and all, so people don't make the same mistakes twice... I say warts, but yeah. I mean the smell."
646,Wriothesley,Furina,"Miss Furina displayed a severe lack of interest in my trial and excused herself early, probably because I pleaded guilty to all charges as soon as they were announced. Disappointing the Hydro Archon is a big deal, so... suppose I've got no choice but to keep gifting her copious amounts of the highest quality tea."
647,Wriothesley,Lyney,"I'll admit that when I removed the House of the Hearth's spies in the underworld, that was kind of an intentional provocation to the Fatui. But their only response was to send down a bunch of children... Was it because they truly saw those kids as disposable? Or because they knew I wouldn't have it in me to let them come to serious harm? *sigh*"
648,Wriothesley,Navia,"The Fortress of Meropide works with Spina di Rosula on some matters regarding supplies and logistics, but we don't have any other dealings. This isn't because I don't trust Navia or her abilities, in fact, I hold her in quite high regard. The only reason we continue to stay out of each other's way is because I wanna honor the agreement I made with the late Mr. Callas."
649,Wriothesley,Neuvillette,"I was once summoned by Neuvillette to discuss some matters with him in his office. When I approached the Palais Mermonia, I saw him standing by the road, completely drenched in the rain. I held out an umbrella for him, and while he thanked me politely, his expression was a little... distressed, I guess. I can only assume that I had disturbed him in the middle of something."
650,Wriothesley,Sigewinne,"Sigewinne the head nurse possesses all the virtues associated with the medical profession and genuinely cares for the well-being of everyone around her.She seems to have picked up some bad habits from me, though, like frequently betting with her Melusine friends over who'd be able to put more stickers on my belongings. Hm? No, I'm not actually bothered by it."
651,Xiangling,Baizhu,"I can smell Mist Grasss! It must be Dr. Baizhu! What is he doing here? *Shocked* Are you OK? Do you feel faint? Is your stomach sore? Or is it a sore throat? I've got it, you're fatigued from all that adventuring! No?... You're fine? Phew! Otherwise, he would've made you drink some traditional herbal medicine — it's so bitter!"
652,Xiangling,Beidou,"Oh, Beidou is the greatest! Every time I go out sailing with her, she always manages to fish up lots of fresh ingredients! Octopus tentacles go great in soup, and seaweed fries up great with some chilies. Not just Beidou, but everyone on board The Crux loves my cooking."
653,Xiangling,Chongyun,"Chongyun? I always see him on his way to eat at Wanmin Restaurant with Xingqiu... Ah... or perhaps I should say I see him being dragged there by Xingqiu? Chongyun doesn't eat hot food. Every time the hot food arrives, Xingqiu politely apologizes and proceeds to try every dish. I just wanna dig in with him! The look on Chongyun's face is priceless. They're quite interesting, those two."
654,Xiangling,Diona,"Diona, from Springvale! Ah, I heard she mixes a great drink, so I came specifically to see her! I thought perhaps I could use her secrets in my cooking, and bring out more flavors. But the tips that she gave me — like soaking lizard tails in beer, or putting bits of smoked fish in dandelion wine — all came out really awful. *sigh* Guess it's up to me to work it out myself, then."
655,Xiangling,Gaming,"Oh boy, once I know Gaming is coming, I make sure to prepare a huge pot of tea in advance. You know, so he can wash some of the spicy food down. I've offered to tone down the spice a bit for him, but he absolutely insists that he prefers the authentic flavor... And he's not even just saying that to be polite. Believe me, I know a true foodie when I see one! Anyway, if that's what he prefers, then who am I to disappoint, hehe!"
656,Xiangling,Ganyu,"Ganyu? Oh... Oh yeah! I remember her — vegetarian, right? She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often — but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her."
657,Xiangling,Hu Tao,"Is Hu Tao picking on you too? Ugh, that prankster always waits till I least expect it, creeps up on me from behind and then... Boo! ...then laughs herself silly. Hmph. But I can handle it, and she does bring me fermented plum blossoms once in a while so I can make flower cakes... so I don't hold a grudge."
658,Xiangling,Ningguang,"That was the Tianquan! Did you see? She just walked past. Come here... closer... Let me tell you, she knows everything that happens in Liyue, so... keep a low profile, don't attract her attention!"
659,Xiangling,Xinyan,"Xinyan always comes to the Wanming Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine times out of ten, she enjoys them too! She's great."
660,Xiangling,Yaoyao,"Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior..."
661,Xiangling,Yelan,"Yelan? Of course, I remember her! When I first met her, I was certain she'd be the kind of gal who'd prefer lighter dishes... turned out that she can handle the most spice out of all my customers! Apparently, my dishes weren't spicy enough for her, because she started taking bites of raw Jueyun Chilis! Truly amazing."
662,Xiangling,Zhongli,"I've come across a lot of fussy eaters, but Mr. Zhongli is very particular and has no problem getting straight to what he has to say. The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: ""It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu."" I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?"
663,Xianyun,Gaming,"One is very fond of Gaming. He is good-hearted and entertaining in conversation, but never grandiloquent. We first met when one was resting by a lake, and he very kindly shared some of his provisions with me. Later, he commented that one seemed to be a wise elder, worthier of respect than even the adepti themselves... Hehe, this wise elder will be sure to look out for him after that."
664,Xianyun,Ganyu,"One once asked Ganyu what she typically works on during her overtime hours. Her response was filled with hideous-sounding words, such as ""meeting minutes,"" ""summaries,"" ""annual reports,"" ""financial projections""... Hmph, were she not of qilin blood, and had one not taught to her the secrets of cultivating health, this avalanche of bureaucratic writ would have surely overwhelmed her... When you see her next, would you check that she's been drinking her Qingxin Infusion of Clear Sight on a daily basis?"
665,Xianyun,Hu Tao,"That young lady says the most bizarre-sounding things, yet she appears to be rather highly regarded by the staff of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor — even Rex Lapis himself saw fit to serve under her in some sort of ""consultancy"" capacity... Allegedly, she is similarly peculiar when it comes to her taste in food. One must admit, one finds eccentrics like her rather intriguing."
666,Xianyun,Keqing,"Keqing is a thoughtful child. She visits me on behalf of the Qixing every festival without fail, and always brings a gift. With such a capable and considerate colleague by her side, perhaps one needn't worry too much about Ganyu..."
667,Xianyun,Ningguang,"The Tianquan conducts her business with great adroitness, and is meticulous in her speech. Hmph, one must admit that Liyue is thriving under the governance of the Qixing. One has been observing her closely in the hope of discovering her secret... Ahem, that was for your ears only — please do not relay it to her."
668,Xianyun,Shenhe,"Shenhe told me that once, when she was delivering an order for Wanmin Restaurant, she ran across the rooftops to save time. Her customer was terrified when she jumped down onto their doorstep, and was about to call for the Millelith... Fortunately, Shenhe disappeared as quickly as she arrived, leaving the food delivery behind and making haste before the customer had time to react. It seems she is growing more proficient at handling crises all the time — one could not be more pleased."
669,Xianyun,Xiangling,"One happened to mention the Supreme Cuisine Machine in conversation with Xiangling once, but one was rather taken aback when she responded by saying that a dish is inauthentic unless it is prepared by hand... Hmph, are one's devices not also the work of one's hands? Inauthentic indeed... A contest is in order! ...Although, her mastery of Liyue cuisine is indeed impressive... Yes — the contest shall have to wait until one has made a few improvements to the device..."
670,Xianyun,Xiao,"The Conqueror of Demons is even more withdrawn than oneself — he has been sighted a mere handful of times at social gatherings over the centuries... One was interested to learn that you are on rather good terms with him — what sort of conversations do the two of you tend to have? Oh, and do let me know when you next plan to see him. Perhaps one could make some tofu pudding for you to pass on to him."
671,Xianyun,Yaoyao,"Yaoyao once pinched my glasses from my face and tried them on for herself — she found it terribly entertaining, and couldn't stop giggling... Ah, children are able to find all sorts of ways to amuse themselves."
672,Xianyun,Yun Jin,"There are many Liyue operas adapted from stories about the adepti, including some based on one's own life and exploits... One has never watched those, of course — what could be more embarrassing than watching someone else play oneself on the stage? One would, however, be interested to evaluate how well Yun Jin did in her adaptation of Shenhe's story, when one has time to go and see it."
673,Xianyun,Zhongli,"When Rex Lapis first heard of one's plan to take up residence in Liyue Harbor, he recited a long and detailed list of considerations for the furnishing and adornment of a home. Natural lighting, ventilation, bespoke woodwork, procuring porcelain, placement of plants and flowers... One's mind felt ready to explode from the deluge of information. Do all facets of life in the human world take so much effort?"
674,Xiao,Baizhu,"You want... Baizhu to make a medicine to take away my pain? I understand your intentions, but mortal medicine has no effect on adepti."
675,Xiao,Beidou,"Beidou? I have nothing to do with her. Though there is such a thing as the leviathan. As a mere human, she has proven her power in defeating Haishan."
676,Xiao,Ganyu,"Ganyu is neither mortal nor illuminated beast. Wandering both the mortal and Adepti realms with duty as her sole guide, it was inevitable that she would become perplexed... What? Me? You believe a Yaksha who knows nothing more than how to massacre countless souls and emerge unscathed is a suitable mentor for such an individual? ...Your mind occupies a very different world from that which your body inhabits."
677,Xiao,Hu Tao,"Hu Tao? Her liveliness is irritating. Fortunately, she is also humorous, so you need not worry about her growing into a boring human."
678,Xiao,Shenhe,"It seems Shenhe places a great deal of trust in you. Well, how could she not. There are few people in the world as kind and good-natured as you."
679,Xiao,Venti,Venti? So that's the name he goes by. His tunes are... forget it.
680,Xiao,Yelan,"I've heard that she once investigated The Chasm, following the trail of the Millelith. If she can investigate mysteries like that on her own, she must be someone of rare skill."
681,Xiao,Zhongli,"Can I ask... Zhongli — what does he do with his days? Huh? Birds, antiques, flowers...Hmm... What deeper meaning do they hold?"
682,Xingqiu,Albedo,"I've thought of all the illustrations I want for each of the major event in the next three volumes! I should write my thoughts down before I forget them, and send them to Mr. Kreideprinz..."
683,Xingqiu,Beidou,"I have great respect for Lady Beidou. I just wish she wouldn't call me ""kid"" and ruffle my hair each time she sees me."
684,Xingqiu,Chongyun,"Ah, dear Chongyun. Though he understands me quite well, one has to exercise caution when teaming up with him to go on a quest. He is making good progress in the martial arts, but I would say he hasn't quite internalized the chivalric code yet... He needs more practice. Especially at eating spicy food..."
685,Xingqiu,Gaming,"Gaming's work has all the trappings of a chivalric hero. Picture the scene — on a dark and moonless night, a lone young figure clad in black stands fearless on a secluded country road. They say his mastery of the martial arts is unparalleled, and the mythical beast by his side always does his bidding... Bandits and brigands beware, for none who challenge him come away unscathed... When he has the time, I'd love to hear more about his experiences as a guard. You should come along too."
686,Xingqiu,Hu Tao,"Ah yes, the young lady who is now the Master of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. If you're asking what I think about her as a person... Well, there are all sorts of rumors about the way she works. But I think if you really want to understand someone, you need to find out what they are really after."
687,Xingqiu,Ningguang,"In her capacity as the Tianquan, I am obliged to respect her. Otherwise, it could create issues for my father and brother. On a personal level? Let me think... I think I will go with ""no comment."" I shan't speak ill of others."
688,Xingqiu,Qiqi,I've always thought that there is more to Qiqi than meets the eye. But it's impossible to have a conversation with her when Baizhu's around. Hmm... We could wait till Baizhu makes a home call to one of his other patients and corner her...
689,Xingqiu,Shenhe,"I find that Miss Shenhe seems to look at me somewhat fiercely, so I daren't approach her lightly. Bizarre, did I inadvertently upset her? Or maybe... upset someone close to her?"
690,Xingqiu,Xiangling,"When you first spot Xiangling out and about, the first thing you should do is check the look on her face. Especially when she's just coming back from collecting new ingredients — the more excited she looks, the more dangerous it is to approach. Because if she sees you, she'll force you to taste-test her latest concoction... I usually get Chongyun to handle these situations, hehe..."
691,Xingqiu,Xinyan,Where does Xinyan perform? Anywhere from Chihu Rock to Yujing Terrace — no spot is untouched by her disruptive presence... A quiet day when I can curl up with a good book is a rare treasure indeed.
692,Xingqiu,Yelan,"Have you heard the expression ""same person, different face""? Ms. Yelan gives me precisely this feeling. When she came to visit my family, my father and brother treated her with respect, and she was pleasant and polite in return. She seemed like a kind and mature young lady to me. But when I saw her elsewhere, she gave a completely different impression."
693,Xingqiu,Yun Jin,"When Yun Jin drinks a beverage she is fond of, she will be inspired to write a new play. So, I keep a jar of tea leaves under my bed at all times, ready to deliver to her on the day that her inspiration dries up. This way, I shall never run out of heroic tales to listen to!"
694,Xingqiu,Zhongli,"My father and brother entertained that gentleman as a guest once. From the way they were acting, he must be a very high-profile figure indeed. I also heard that he directs funerals for adepti, so he must surely have great depth to his character. We should do some digging and see what we can find out about him!"
695,Xinyan,Baizhu,"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations."
696,Xinyan,Beidou,"Her? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all the sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is."
697,Xinyan,Chongyun,"He's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!"
698,Xinyan,Gaming,"The first time Gaming told me I had a bad case of ""rock 'n' roll fever,"" I checked my forehead to see if he was right. My temperature was fine, so I denied it. But he insisted it was true. We went back and forth arguing about it for hours before I realized it was all just a misunderstanding. Gaming explained that it was just another way to say you're a fan of something. Hahaha, there's never a dull moment when Gaming's around. Anyway, I've definitely come 'round to ""rock 'n' roll fever"" as an expression — I'll have to work it into the lyrics next time I write a song!"
699,Xinyan,Hu Tao,"I've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Always greets me cheerily too, saying ""I like people who play with fire, they're good for business"" or somethin' like that... She's a bit bizarre, I tell you."
700,Xinyan,Ningguang,"Y'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so..."
701,Xinyan,Xiangling,"I have dinner at the Wanmin Restaurant often. If Xiangling's got some time on her hands, we'll chat till it's real late. Eh? You wanna know what I order? See... I actually eat everything she makes. It's never the same thing, and the flavor's different each time, too. Ooh, she's the rock star of the culinary world, she is!"
702,Xinyan,Yun Jin,"Tell you a secret — but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha."
703,Xinyan,Zhongli,"There was this one fellow who invited me to perform at his place, back when there weren't many who would give my music the time of day. I was touched, let me tell you what. Like, hey, someone gets it! I agreed right away... But when I got there, I found out that he was the consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. What a weird guy. I mean, how was that appropriate?"
704,Yae Miko,Arataki Itto,"Ah, the oddball oni. Heh, I hear that he's been quite a pain for the Kujou Clan. The Tenryou Commission wanted to remove his messages on the bulletin board, claiming that they were ""harmful to public order."" I made quite sure they stayed put, haha. He's an entertaining character... you don't often see oni like him in this day and age."
705,Yae Miko,Ganyu,"Hmm, now that you mention it, it's been a while since I last saw Ganyu. Before the Sakoku Decree came into effect, the two of us would often meet to discuss bilateral relations between our two nations. I always found her quite reliable. The next time you go to Liyue, take her some more fresh Sea Ganoderma for me."
706,Yae Miko,Gorou,He certainly has a beautiful tail. Although... mine's a little softer.
707,Yae Miko,Kamisato Ayaka,"I'm very fond indeed of the Yashiro Commission girl. She adroitly handles every matter that comes before her. Unfortunately, it's often thankless work. Pity. Were she not a member of the Kamisato Clan, I would have long since snatched her up for the Yae Publishing House."
708,Yae Miko,Kamisato Ayato,"The Yashiro rascal... he's always been an unpredictable one, even as a child. Don't be taken in by his warm smile. There's no knowing what devious scheme might be brewing inside his head — it's really quite maddening... What do you mean, ""sly as a fox""? Hmph, if you're trying to insinuate that he and I are anything alike, you are sorely mistaken."
709,Yae Miko,Kirara,"More youkai have expressed an interest in the human world lately. I wonder if that's a good thing or not. You want to know what I think? Hehe, I would tell them to live for the moment. Besides, how could I ever dislike a little youkai who would willingly take us out to dinner and pay for the meal?"
710,Yae Miko,Kujou Sara,"Not the sharpest tengu in the forest — she certainly didn't inherit the brilliant mind of daddy tengu, that's for sure. *sigh* How shall I put this? I suppose being blunt and dispensing with tact has its own advantages... But I do hope that the next time she visits the shrine, she keeps to herself. I've got better things to do than answer her incessant questions about Ei."
711,Yae Miko,Kuki Shinobu,"I've heard a lot about Miyuki's little sister. Quite the character, I'm told. Although she comes from a family of shrine maidens, she's gone her own way in life — tried her hand at many different trades, studied abroad in Liyue, even ended up joining the Arataki Gang... Fascinating girl. Maybe I should have Miyuki introduce me. Yes, that'll work — Miyuki wouldn't dream of refusing my request."
712,Yae Miko,Raiden Shogun,"Locking herself away in the Plane of Euthymia when she clearly wants to be out — it's just willful self-torture, really... On the other hand, it's also rather stubborn-but-cute, don't you think?"
713,Yae Miko,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"These Divine Priestesses seem to be getting cuter every generation. I wonder how she looks performing the Dance of Divine Peace... Perhaps even little schools of fish swish around her while she spins. If she's ever looking for a more experienced head shrine maiden to learn from, I'd be quite happy to share a few tips with her... Hehe, as long as she asked me nicely, of course."
714,Yae Miko,Sayu,"Ah yes, the little ninja child... If there's one thing she can do, it's stay hidden. Kano Nana constantly complains to me about it. Apparently, she now spends so much of her time searching for Sayu that she barely has any time to read anymore. If you ask me, I'd say that Sayu has a secret ally who is helping her hide all the time..."
715,Yae Miko,Wanderer,"I thought it was a disaster waiting to happen at the time, but she insisted that she wasn't going to lift a finger against the object of her own creation. Had I known how things would unfold, I would have simply disposed of it without her knowing. Hmm? What about now? Hehe... Well, we're no longer waiting for the disaster to happen, are we?"
716,Yae Miko,Yoimiya,"Naganohara fireworks are well worth the wait every year. Word is that she caused quite an uproar among the Tenryou Commission recently by setting off fireworks all over the place. Heh, I'm sure the members of the Kujou Clan must've turned purple with rage... A pity that I couldn't be there to see it for myself."
717,Yanfei,Eula,"Eula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all."
718,Yanfei,Ganyu,"Ganyu is kind and thoughtful, it's just a shame she's so busy all the time. Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork — the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers."
719,Yanfei,Hu Tao,"I always hear people saying that the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an unorthodox approach to business. They think she's gone a little non compos mentis after being in the funeral business so long... What are these people talking about? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. Work is just work — there are no good and bad jobs, or lucky and unlucky jobs, just jobs that need doing.If I had one gripe, it would be that the director rarely comes to me for legal advice, hmph..."
720,Yanfei,Keqing,"The Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me."
721,Yanfei,Kuki Shinobu,"Shinobu? I remember her, she's the Inazuman girl that came to Liyue as an exchange student to specialize in law. When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back..."
722,Yanfei,Ningguang,"You must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices. Every round of additions, retractions, and revisions generates mountains of material. Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...Hmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law. Once I've finished memorizing these, I need to step up my productivity..."
723,Yanfei,Qiqi,"I heard that little herb gatherer has written out a whole set of behavioral rules for herself. She may be small, but boy, has she got her head screwed on! She's definitely destined for greatness...""The young of today shall outperform us tomorrow,"" as they say. I must admit, she has my respect."
724,Yanfei,Xingqiu,"The Feiyun Commerce Guild is one of my oldest clients. Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton."
725,Yanfei,Yelan,"Yelan is an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs — she once helped me crack a tough accounting fraud case. I treated her to dinner afterward. The only thing is... I feel like she's able to read my mind at any given moment when talking to her... Yes, in the future, I need to make absolutely sure I don't get on the wrong side of her."
726,Yanfei,Zhongli,"Mr. Zhongli has so much in-depth knowledge on so many topics, he's like a walking library, you know what I mean? He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.And yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange... Anyway, makes me wonder if my father is hiding something from me. Hmph, alright then — if he won't tell me what's going on, I'll just have to find out for myself..."
727,Yaoyao,Baizhu,"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are pretty effective. They're bitter, that's for sure, but they always say that about medicine: ""the bitter the better""! So I get it. Huh? Too bitter for you? Don't worry, I've got some Candied Dates here. One of these after you finish your medicine will take the taste away."
728,Yaoyao,Beidou,"Beidou's ship is amazing! If I hadn't promised Ganyu that I wouldn't go on board anymore, I know exactly where I'd set up my own little bed, hee-hee."
729,Yaoyao,Ganyu,"Ganyu always has a lot of work to do. I heard that one time, she was so tired she accidentally fell asleep on the grass. *sigh* I do worry about her, you know! Hmm, maybe... we could go do a ""surprise inspection""! You know, check in and make sure she's taking care of herself. Oh! Uh... Wait a minute, I'll go get some of her favorite plants for her to eat..."
730,Yaoyao,Keqing,"Keqing's a very thoughtful person, and she always does a good job of everything. She also makes sure to pay Master a visit at every festival... She's what you call a ""bastion of piety."" Or wait, maybe it's ""paragon of propriety""? ...Well, anyway, I think I can learn a lot from her!"
731,Yaoyao,Qiqi,"Qiqi's my best friend! She forgets who I am sometimes, but I know she doesn't mean it... I just have to remind her to check her notebook, and she remembers me right away.
I once asked Dr. Baizhu in private if there's any way to cure her, and, um... But it doesn't matter. I'll probably have to keep reminding her who I am for my whole life, but that's okay."
732,Yaoyao,Shenhe,"Shenhe's been away from the human world for years and years, so it's no wonder that she's still adjusting to life in Liyue Harbor. I'd love to help Ganyu take care of her... But how do I ask her in a way that won't make her feel uncomfortable?"
733,Yaoyao,Xiangling,"Xiangling hasn't been, um... looking for strange ingredients lately, has she? She gave me a real fright last time. She said she was about to try some raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds. One of these days, she'll give herself an upset stomach — then what's she gonna do? 'Cause she definitely doesn't like taking Dr. Baizhu's medicine... Anyway, I got Master to try and talk some sense into her, too. Who knows what dangerous thing she'll be trying to eat next... *sigh*"
734,Yaoyao,Xianyun,"When I went to look for Master the other day, I found her chatting with a very elegant-looking lady. She said her name was ""Xianyun,"" but her hijinks didn't fool me! I could tell it was Aunty Cloud Retainer right away! I mean, Master looked like she was really happy to see her, so how could it be a stranger? Evidently, she was an old friend!"
735,Yaoyao,Yanfei,"Yanfei takes that huge legal codex everywhere, even when she comes to pay Master a visit on her days off. She's incredible! I don't know how she carries that heavy thing around all the time, and I can't imagine how much hard work it must be to read it..."
736,Yaoyao,Yun Jin,"Now, Yun Jin's really good at spear dancing, and her Liyue opera performances are very popular. Master even takes me to go see them sometimes. You won't find an empty seat when she's on stage... but, um... does anyone understand what she's singing about?"
737,Yelan,Ganyu,"Ah, the secretary... I could never work non-stop like she does, certainly not at that level of efficiency. I guess being half-adeptus must have its perks. Imagine not needing sleep to regain your energy levels..."
738,Yelan,Keqing,"I don't really like people who cram their schedules full, because it doesn't leave any room for negotiation. If something happens that they didn't anticipate, it throws their plans into oblivion, impacting not just themselves but their coworkers, too. But the Yuheng is different. She works in a very methodical way. I always enjoy working with her."
739,Yelan,Ningguang,"I got to know Ningguang a long time ago, before she was a Qixing, and we worked together for a while. Maybe I'm partly to thank for the fact that she became a Qixing so quickly. Hehe, who can say? Anyway, she was the one who recommended this job to me. It was a good choice, I'm very well-suited to it.
Ningguang is good to work with. But I have to be mindful of our identities when I'm out in public. When I meet a Qixing as an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, they're ""Sir"" or ""Lady"" to me."
740,Yelan,Tartaglia,"The Fatui harbinger? He helped me out once — unwittingly. I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base."
741,Yelan,Xiangling,"Ah, Xiangling, the lovely little chef. Her ingredients are always top quality, easily as good as Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk. Sometimes I go to her for dried Jueyun Chilis... She doesn't seem to understand why I eat them in the way that I do, and I don't feel like trying to explain it to her, either. It's just a family tradition."
742,Yelan,Xiao,"The elders in my clan once said that we must always show the utmost respect to the Vigilant Yaksha. Apparently, the only time that our ancestor would gain some temporary relief from his insanity was when passing by the Wangshu Inn. It must have been the comforting effect of his presence that wards off evil spirits. That said, if I ever have the honor of fighting side by side with the Conqueror of Demons, I will focus only on the mission. I cannot let myself be distracted by concerns about his status."
743,Yelan,Xingqiu,"Of course I remember him — the young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. I have dealings with his family all the time. Who knows... maybe one day, he'll be outsmarting everyone around him, too."
744,Yelan,Yanfei,"I like Yanfei a lot. And I'm not talking about our friendship — as a high-profile legal consultant, important intel in Liyue Harbor is constantly flowing in her direction. Whenever I help her out, I always get some invaluable leads in return. I gotta say though, sometimes I think she respects me a little too much."
745,Yoimiya,Arataki Itto,"Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?"
746,Yoimiya,Beidou,"Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise."
747,Yoimiya,Kaedehara Kazuha,"People with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure."
748,Yoimiya,Kamisato Ayaka,"We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word ""ladylike"" was practically made just for her.
We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths."
749,Yoimiya,Kirara,"The courier from Komaniya Express? She's super reliable and really quick on her feet! Ingredients used in coloring the fireworks always run out quickly, but she always delivers a new batch right when I need them! I gave her a firework once as a thank-you gift, but she was too scared to light it, saying that she got spooked once by the sound of fireworks. Hehe, so I told her to find a nice viewing spot far away and set it off for her."
750,Yoimiya,Klee,"Wait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?"
751,Yoimiya,Kujou Sara,"Due to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!"
752,Yoimiya,Raiden Shogun,"Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the ""eternity"" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has ""eternity"" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty."
753,Yoimiya,Sayu,"Let me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!"
754,Yoimiya,Thoma,"He's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle."
755,Yoimiya,Yae Miko,"Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, ""isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?"" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?"
756,Yun Jin,Hu Tao,"Ah yes, Hu Tao. Very expressive face, and she has a sharp mind too — you can be discussing the most mundane thing in the world, and she'll always bring out a string of witty remarks. I admire her a lot. There's never a dull moment when you have friends like her around."
757,Yun Jin,Kaedehara Kazuha,"Kaedehara Kazuha is among the many outlanders who enjoy Liyue opera. Whether it's an orchestral section or a percussive piece, he always sits there and listens quietly. Talk about great manners!"
758,Yun Jin,Keqing,"I have yet to see the Yuheng ever attend an opera performance. Now that I think about it, whenever I happen to see her out on the street, she always seems to be in a great hurry."
759,Yun Jin,Ningguang,The Tianquan is a big spender and has made several very generous donations to our troupe. I can only return her generosity by delivering my best possible performance.
760,Yun Jin,Shenhe,"I have long since known ""The Divine Damsel of Devastation"" inside out, back to front, but it was only very recently that I learned that the ""divine damsel"" in question is actually a real person. Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again."
761,Yun Jin,Xingqiu,"Oh, so you are also acquainted with Xingqiu? Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you."
762,Yun Jin,Xinyan,"The elders of the troupe are always harping on about rock 'n' roll being a bad influence. Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. ""It's for your own good,"" they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that."
763,Yun Jin,Zhongli,"The customs of the opera are very particular, and are passed down from generation to generation. Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?"
764,Zhongli,Furina,"She made a contract with her own self to save the nation, strictly adhered to it for over five centuries without once wavering, and even fooled the Heavenly Principles in the end... I have great respect for approaches to justice that place exacting demands not only on others, but also on the self. Though her divinity has vanished and the throne of the Archon is no more, Furina will go down in Fontaine's history as a God of Justice worthy of recognition."
765,Zhongli,Ganyu,"Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom. It is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time. If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval."
766,Zhongli,Hu Tao,The current overseer of the funeral parlor? Ahem. I cannot deal with that child.
767,Zhongli,Keqing,"She is the most impious of the Qixing — but I actually find the conviction of such people quite endearing. The only reason I was able to consider taking a step back from such overarching management of Liyue was because there are people like her. People who speak up when they believe themselves to be right, and then go and do something decisive about it."
768,Zhongli,Nahida,"As well as ruling over all of Sumeru, the God of Wisdom, Buer, has a duty to guard Irminsul. Only one who possesses great wisdom could hope to shoulder these responsibilities. All life in Teyvat owes her gratitude for saving Irminsul."
769,Zhongli,Ningguang,"Despite the multitude of affairs she deals with in a day, Ningguang always continues to press on. A rare gem indeed. I'm reminded of the time that she used to walk barefoot from Yaoguang Shoal to the south wharf, trying to sell her wares as she went. Time is cruel to humans."
770,Zhongli,Raiden Shogun,"Time tempers all volition. Yet she would give up everyone for her beliefs. Perhaps it is for this very reason that she has come to where she stands today... Should the chance come by me, I too would like to learn of the Eternity for which she so earnestly endeavors."
771,Zhongli,Tartaglia,"That rascal from Snezhnaya has yet to depart from Liyue? Heh, no matter. Just let me know if he gives you any trouble. I shall deal with the matter swiftly.
It's said that Childe and his reputation have yet again stirred up waves among the inner ranks of the Fatui. Knowing his type, he will be sure to swiftly depose anyone who dares to challenge his actions. Hmm... Come to think of it, there will be a lot of interesting news to be heard the next time we gather for drinks. Care to join me when the time comes, Traveler?"
772,Zhongli,Venti,"*sniff* Tsk... It reeks of wine. That bard has just been through here, hasn't he? That drunkard is a disgrace to the arts. Oh... Has he tricked you into getting drunk? You're slurring a little. Wait a moment, I'll brew a pot of sobering tea. It'll be ready in only six hours, so just wait a moment."
773,Zhongli,Xianyun,"I hear many merchants of Liyue tell tales of a Ms. Xianyun. By most accounts, she appears proud and taciturn upon first glance, yet in conversation, people find her to be forthright and fair-minded, and they are pleased to make her acquaintance. I am glad to hear this. But... I have also heard a great many accounts lauding her readiness to part with large sums of Mora..."
774,Zhongli,Xiao,"You speak of the young adeptus of Guili Plains... *sigh* Still fulfilling his duty to this very day. Please give this Remedium Tertiorum to him on my behalf. Oh, yes... be sure not to let Paimon eat them. Nothing of this world can withstand the power of this medicine."
775,Zhongli,Yanfei,"Despite never having signed a contract with me, she upholds order within many strata of Liyue society in her own way, dispelling misconceptions and correcting biases... Should her father one day return from his travels, I imagine that he would be even more delighted than I."
